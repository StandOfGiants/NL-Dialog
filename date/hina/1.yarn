As the remainder of your fellow Marines drift off to the mess hall or other tasks, you find yourself approached by none other than Rear Admiral Hina. She coolly exhales a stream of cigarette smoke and regards you with an appraising, steely gaze.

Hina: Hina was impressed with your conduct today, {$name}. Hina values someone who can obey and execute orders.

-> Well, it was easy when they're given by someone so competent.
    Hina: Tch, you think Hina is susceptible to flattery? Hina has little tolerance for sycophancy and simpering. If you want to impress Hina, let your actions and obedience to the Marines speak for themselves, not try to cozy up to your superiors.
    Hina: You're dismissed.
    <<jump date_hina_1_DateEndsEarly>>
-> Thanks! You and Smoker are really cool!
    Hina: Hina appreciates your, err... enthusiasm. Work hard and you'll see that the Marines reward obedience and talent.
    Hina: You're dismissed. //
    <<jump date_hina_1_DateEndsEarly>>
-> [i]salute[/i] Thank you, I did my best, Rear Admiral.
    Hina: Fufufu, at ease, sailor. Work hard and you'll see that the Marines reward obedience and talent. Come, join Hina in the garden. We will discuss your performance.

//  background transition to be implemented
The Rear Admiral leads you away from the ship and across the beach to the small Japanese garden, a common rest spot for many after a hard day's training. Though Hina complemented your 'performance' at today's drill, you cannot also help but feel that you might be in trouble.
Her perfectly applied lipstick, leather gloves and commanding demeanor make you feel like you're one wrong move from galley duty the rest of the week.
Though you have to admit, the thought of Hina looking down on you while you scrub the decks, offering the occasional scornful remark, does seem to have a certain appeal...

//  does she sit down somewhere?
Hina: Hina is curious what made you want to join the Marines, {$name}. It is clear you are precise, driven, and obedient. Hina values these things in a recruit.

//  character transition to be implemented for dialogue section
-> It's been my dream since I was a child.
    Hina: Fufufufu, a childhood dream of heroic deeds and pursuing villains across the seas? Fufufufu, how charming. Hina is amused.
    -> Well, why did you join the Marines?
        Hina: Why did Hina become a Marine? Nobody has asked Hina that in quite some time.
        Hina: Fufufu, that is a question for another day perhaps, if you prove yourself worthy of Hina's time and attention; prove that you're more than childish dreams and idealism.
        -> How can I do that?
            <<jump date_hina_1_HowCanIProveMyself>>
        -> I would do anything to prove myself to you!
            <<jump date_hina_1_NoSimps>>
        -> Are you making fun of my dreams?
            <<jump date_hina_1_AreYouMakingFun>>
    -> Why do you talk like that?
        Hina: Excuse me? Talk like what? Has no one taught you how to speak to your superiors? You will be scrubbing the deck for the rest of the week for your impertinence.
        Hina: You're dismissed.
        <<jump date_hina_1_DateEndsEarly>>
    -> Are you making fun of my dreams?
        <<jump date_hina_1_AreYouMakingFun>>

-> I want to protect and help innocent people.
    Hina: Fufufufu. Innocence. Such a concept. Hina is amused.
    -> Well, why did you join the Marines?
        Hina: Why did Hina become a Marine? Nobody has asked Hina that in quite some time.
        Hina: Fufufu, that is a question for another day perhaps, if you prove yourself worthy of Hina's time and attention.
        -> How can I do that?

        -> I would do anything to prove myself to you!
            <<jump date_hina_1_NoSimps>>
        -> What's so amusing about it?
            Hina: Hina has heard stories like yours before, {$name}. Young recruits who believe in naive ideas of noble deeds and heroics on the high seas. //  following sentences doesn't make sense: If you became a Marine for a charming life of adventure and noble heroics. The sea and what you will encounter out there is far crueler than that. //  rephase as "If ..., then ..." or something else to juxtapose "...far crueller than that"
            -> I'm absolutely prepared for whatever is out there.
                Hina: Hina has seen this kind of naivety get young recruits killed. Don't think for a moment that because you aced Hina's drill, you're untouchable out there in a real battle. Deflate your ego, {$name}, and come seek Hina again when you are ready to submit yourself to her guidance.
                Hina: You're dismissed.
                <<jump date_hina_1_DateEndsEarly>>
            -> I know that I have a lot to learn.
                <<jump date_hina_1_Part2>>
    -> Why do you talk like that?
        Hina: Excuse me? Talk like what? Has no one taught you how to speak to your superiors? You will be scrubbing the deck for the rest of the week for your impertinence.
        Hina: You're dismissed.
        <<jump date_hina_1_DateEndsEarly>>
    -> What's so amusing about it?
        Hina: Hina has heard stories like yours before, {$name}. Young recruits who believe in naive ideas of noble deeds and heroics on the high seas. //  same issue as before. If you became a Marine for a charming life of adventure and noble heroics. The sea and what you will encounter out there is far crueler than that. // perhaps "the sea will disabuse you of that quickly"?
        -> I know that I have a lot to learn
            <<jump date_hina_1_Part2>>
        -> I'm absolutely prepared for whatever is out there
            Hina: Hina has seen this kind of naivety get young recruits killed. Don't think for a moment that because you aced Hina's drill, you're untouchable out there in a real battle. Deflate your ego, {$name}, and come seek Hina again when you are ready to submit yourself to her guidance.
            Hina: You're dismissed.
            <<jump date_hina_1_DateEndsEarly>>

-> It seemed like a stable career.
    Hina: Indeed. It is a worthy cause and one with a good benefits package, fufufu.
    -> What kind of benefits, Rear Admiral?
        Hina: Well, one might say the pursuit of justice is its [i]own[/i] benefit, fufufu. If you seek to develop yourself or exercise a special skill or talent, Hina can point you in the right direction.
        -> I want to know how I can be the best Marine possible!
            <<jump date_hina_1_Part2>>
        -> I want to punish those who would hurt innocent people.
            Hina: Mmm... so you value punishment, discipline. Hina is intrigued.
            -> Yes, those who harm others should be dealt with accordingly.
                <<jump date_hina_1_Part2>>
            -> Yes. Without punishment, justice is meaningless.
                Hina: Fufufu, Hina has friends in Impel Down with similar values. She almost worked there, you know? But Hina's power is meaningless once evil has already been locked up and contained. What Hina excels in is pursuit and capture. It is... one of the many benefits of this job.
                -> That sounds kind of intense.
                    Hina: If you find the pursuit of justice and its ensuing punishment [i]intense[/i], perhaps this is not the career for you, {$name}. Hina has high hopes for you, {$name}, and Hina does not like to be disappointed.
                    Hina: You're dismissed, {$name}. Thank you for your time. Hina will be watching you.
                    <<jump date_hina_1_DateEndsEarly>>
                -> That sounds great.
                    Hina: Fufufufu, Hina appreciates enthusiasm in the ranks. It is a perk of the job that many simply do not appreciate and may even avoid. Captains Coby or Tashigi prefer to resolve things peacefully with little conflict.
                    Hina: Tch, such naivety. Hina finds such restraint tiresome.
                    <<jump date_hina_1_Part2>>
        -> I want to have a good relationship with my superiors.
            Hina: You would be wise to be mindful of trying to curry favor with those above you, {$name}. While respect for one's superiors is admirable, you will find that Hina is not so easily swayed by simpering compliments and eager smiles.
            Hina: You're dismissed.
            <<jump date_hina_1_DateEndsEarly>>
    -> Why did you join the Marines?
        Hina: Why did Hina become a Marine? Nobody has asked Hina that in quite some time.
        Hina: Fufufu, that is a question for another day perhaps, if you prove yourself worthy of Hina's time and attention.

Hina: Tch, many young recruits come to the Marines brimming with idealistic childhood dreams of heroism, {$name}. Captain Coby and his partner Helmeppo, even Captain Tashigi, believe in a naive, guileless definition of [i]justice[/i], of heroics and bravery on the high seas. Our mission is not noble deeds for the applause of an adoring public. The seas and the piracy that you will encounter out there are far crueler.

She regards you coolly from behind her cigarette, the smallest of smirks playing on her face. You cannot quite tell if she is making fun of you, or interrogating you. You're not sure which you prefer, the idea of her red lips smirking at your silly dreams, or her iron-cold eyes drilling you for information. Both have their appeal.

Hina: Well, if you are here to learn, Hina is curious what you are hoping to gain from your time in the Marines. Daydreaming and fantasizing about adventures of grandeur will only get you so far, {$name}. All recruits come to us for one reason or another. Hina is curious about is what it is you are looking for.
-> I'm looking to find a date!
    //  special mention: definitely needs character transition of hina_disgust.png or smth here x3
    Hina: Hina has never heard something so asinine in her life. If Hina hears you speak such drivel again you will be keelhauled. Of all absurd things to say, the pursuit of justice is not... not a [i]dating game[/i].
    Hina: You're dismissed, {$name}. And you will be on galley duty the rest of the week.
    <<jump date_hina_1_DateEndsEarly>>
-> I value any opportunities that might be available to me.
    Hina: Good. Hina is pleased to see your willingness to acknowledge the need for growth in order to be successful. If you wish to administer justice to those deserving of punishment, you cannot be blinded by silly, naive ideas of heroics. Hina appreciates those who are ready to learn.
    -> Yes, I want to be a strong Marine.
        Hina: Hina has plenty of strong Marines. What she appreciates most is a Marine who is obedient.
        -> I'll always obey you, Rear Admiral. Let me prove myself to you!
            <<jump date_hina_1_NoSimps>>
        -> I can follow any order you give me.
            <<jump date_hina_1_Part3>>
        -> What kind of Marine is unquestioningly obedient?
            Hina: You question Hina's definition of justice? Tch, Hina had high hopes for you, {$name}. You will be scrubbing the deck for the rest of the week for your impertinence.
            Hina: You're dismissed.
            <<jump date_hina_1_DateEndsEarly>>
    -> What would you suggest that I learn, Rear Admiral?
        <<jump date_hina_1_Part3>>
-> I want to punish those who would hurt innocent people.
    Hina: Indeed. Punishment is a necessary principle of justice. Without ensuing punishment, justice is weak and meaningless. Pirates and scoundrels must be taught a lesson and made example of, lest they think they can get away with wicked deeds.
    -> Surely not all pirates? (-)
        <<jump date_hina_1_FuckPirates>>
    //  do decrement ("hina.date.points")
    -> Yes, it is a Marine's job to uphold law and order.
        Hina: Indeed. Law and order are the backbone of justice. Marines have rules and regulation; so does the world. Without rules we have no order, no safety. This is precisely what makes piracy so wicked.... Pirates eschew order and control for lawlessness and nihilism. //  small note: elsewhere Hina refers to pirates as "anarchic", and nihilism is a strange choice for One Piece (i could be wrong). possible to standardize the terms she uses to refer to pirates?
        -> But is that really true of all pirates?
            <<jump date_hina_1_FuckPirates>>
        -> I completely agree. That's why I'm here.
            Hina: We have similar values. Hina appreciates this in the pursuit of justice. While one may have their own pillars and beliefs about justice, all are meaningless without consequence and punishment. Hina is curious why you did not apply to work at Impel Down?
            //  "pillars and beliefs" is a strange turn of phrase. does Hina say this in the show? otherwise I suggest changing it.
            -> It was too scary...
                <<jump date_hina_1_Part3>>
            -> They rejected my resume...
                <<jump date_hina_1_Part3>>
            -> I'm not really a fan of the whole torture thing.
                Hina: Fufufufu, oh, Hina thinks you are very entertaining. If you are ever interested in a career there, Hina would be able to assist you with the right training. That is, if Hina does not keep you for her own squad, fufufu.
                -> I would appreciate the opportunity, but only if my performance merits it.(+)
                -> That sounds great!
