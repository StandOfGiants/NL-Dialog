You decide to go for a walk in the park on your day off. It's too lovely out to stay cooped up. To your surprise, though, you not only stumble across an admiral there... but they're also outright napping in the open.
// Feels like a rather jarring and telly introduction. Alternative suggestion provided.
{$name}: "Is that Admiral Aokiji?”
// Adjusted to fit alternate intro suggestion
<<show_character kuzan center fade>>
The Admiral lifts his sleeping mask to eye the PC.
{$kuzan}: Arara, it's {$name}.
-> Good afternoon sir! (2)
    {$kuzan}: What are you doing here?
    -> It's my day off! (1)
        {$kuzan}: Good for you. Care to join me?
        <<jump date_kuzan_1_SitOrNo>>
    -> Taking a walk, but… the grass sure looks comfy. (2)
        {$kuzan}: Sit down, join me.
        <<jump date_kuzan_1_SitOrNo>>
    -> Stuff… what are YOU doing here? (0)
        {$kuzan}: Relaxing, gonna get back to that. See ya around.
        <<jump date_kuzan_1_END>>
// Seems like a rather quick shut down to the date, I'd advise against that - or at least make it a LOT more obvious
-> Hello! Uh, you doing okay down there? (1)
    {$kuzan}: Yup. Care to join me?
    -> Yeah, sure! (1)
        {$kuzan}: -raises an eyebrow- Alright.
        <<jump date_kuzan_1_SitOrNo>>
    -> Mmmm… no, I'm okay, thanks. (0)
        {$kuzan}: Alright. -Goes back to sleep-
        <<jump date_kuzan_1_END>>
    -> Was that...a proposition? (2)
        {$kuzan}: Arara, that's a big word. -He pats the grass beside him-
        <<jump date_kuzan_1_SitOrNo>>
-> It's 11 AM and you're napping? (0)
    {$kuzan}: Yup, gonna get back to that. See ya around.

-> Sit down
-> Nah, I'm good, thanks.
    {$kuzan}: Suit yourself, I'm going back to sleep.
    <<jump date_kuzan_1_END>>

As you are sitting there, a whooshing sound reaches your ears just before...
<<start_effect shake>>
WHAM! Something whacks you in the back of the head! Ow! You turn, seeing a group of kids staring at you before they turn tail and run. You look down to see a bright red frisbee.

-> Well, that hurt. I need a nap to recover.
    <<jump date_kuzan_1_TakeNap>>
-> Huh, neat, free frisbee.
    <<jump date_kuzan_1_PlayFrisbee>>
-> Oh no, they forgot their frisbee!

<<get "TookNapWithKuzan">>
{$kuzan} scoots over to give you space.
You and {$kuzan} settle back down on the grass and nap. The breeze ruffles some leaves and grass. The sun moves across the sky. It's calm and quiet and warm. A perfect activity after a busy week. (4 pts)
// I've never seen anything give such a huge score change before. Might need to be toned down?
{$kuzan}: [wave][i]yawns[/i][/wave]
{$kuzan}: You know, nobody has ever taken me up on a nap before. Thanks for joining me, {$name}. You hungry?

-> Dinner and sleeping together? [wave]My my[/wave] (2)
    {$kuzan}: Arara. Yyou're bold one, huh? Alright, let's see how long that holds up.
-> I, um, I could eat Sir! (1)
    {$kuzan}: Let's go then.
-> Mmmm...think I'm gonna keep napping actually. (0)
    {$kuzan}: Huh, see ya around then.

{$name}: Hey, free frisbee. Wanna play?
{$kuzan}: …Uhh…
-> C'mon when was the last time you played frisbee?
    {$kuzan}: …Too long ago. Damn, now I feel old.
    -> Oof, sorry old man. (0)
        {$kuzan}: Well this old man is going back to sleep. See ya.
        <<jump date_kuzan_1_END>>
    -> Frisbee will fix that (1)
        {$kuzan}: On whose authority?
        -> Mine, now c'mon! Let me be able to say I beat an Admiral at something. (2)
            {$kuzan}: Alright, let's play, {$name}
        -> …If you don't want to play that badly, I can't force you, but it'll be fun, promise! (1)
            {$kuzan}: Alright, let's play.
    -> Age is what you make of it? Or something? It's frisbee, c'mon. (2)
        {$kuzan}: Alright alright, let's play.
-> Let's make use of my suffering.
    {$kuzan}: You want to suffer more from losing?
    -> Oh, confidence. I'll enjoy destroying that. (2)
        {$kuzan}: Alright, let's put that to the test then.
    -> Hey hey, it'll be fun even if I lose! (1)
        {$kuzan}: Huh, guess that's a good attitude.
    -> Maybe you're right, I don't know if I can handle that kind of blow to my self esteem… (0)
        {$kuzan}: Know your limits. I'm gonna get back to napping, now. See ya around.
        <<jump date_kuzan_1_END>>
-> The nap will feel way better after losing to me in Frisbee!
    {$kuzan}: Arara, confident, huh?
    -> Bring it on! (1)
        {$kuzan}: Alright, let's play.
    -> Well, I won't know until I try! (2)
        {$kuzan}: Alright, let's do this I guess.
    -> Why shouldn't I be? Losing is your thing right?
        {$kuzan}: …So that's how it is, huh? You know, I've got some place to be. Bye.
        <<jump date_kuzan_1_END>>

The Admiral takes a position a bit of a ways away from you, waiting for you to hurl the frisbee with all your might! He is an Admiral after all! Although… that might be a little mean.
<<jump date_kuzan_1_FrisbeeThrow>>
// Why is it a little mean?

<<declare $frisbees = 0>>
<<set $frisbees += 1>>
-> Throw with every ounce of strength you possess. (2) <<if  !visited("kd1_frisbee_strong")>>
    <<jump kd1_frisbee_strong>>
-> Throw it normally. (1) <<if !visited("kd1_frisbee_normal")>>
    <<jump kd1_frisbee_normal>>

    <<jump kd1_frisbee_dainty>>
-> Throw it really high! <<if $frisbees > 2>>
    You eject the frisbee skyward! It soars up, up and up! And-! HEY, BIRD, THAT'S NOT YOURS! A crow flies away with your ill gotten frisbee. The two of you watch it disappear into the distance.
    {$kuzan}: Well, that was something. You hungry?
    <<jump date_kuzan_1_GoToLunch>>

You throw the frisbee like your life depends on it. It soars, so fast it's hard to see. A speeding disc of death! Hey, you could turn that into an attack! {$kuzan} doesn't catch it. In fact, it goes right through him! OH NO, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
The frisbee freezes in midair. {$kuzan} reforms, ice filling in the frisbee gap. Uh oh. You… may have bitten off more than you can chew.
{$kuzan}: So that's how it is {$name}...? Catch.
The frisbee comes flying at you. It gleams in the sun. It's like a tiny flat meteor,and you are the nearest gravitational body.
-> Catch the frisbee. (2)
    You take a stance, readying yourself to absorb the full force of the moving object. It's coming, hurdling toward you. Is that boom the sound of it breaking the sound barrier or just your heart beat?! All your senses come alive, you can taste the heat of the air as it grows enormous in front of your face! Your neurons fire, fingers flexing!
    You catch it! Oh. It was actually just a normal throw. That wasn't even hard. The Admiral is laughing at the look on your face.
-> Dodge the frisbee. (0)
    You barely duck in time, diving into the grass as the frisbee soars past you and all the way to the other side of the park. {$kuzan} chuckles at you as you have to go get it.
-> Close your eyes and pray. (0)
    You hear the wind rushing and know the end is nigh. Goodbye sweet world, hello obliv–!
    A rush of cold races over your face! You open your eyes. {$kuzan} is standing in front of you, holding the frisbee in place, an inch from your face. You stare at each other for a long second.
{$kuzan}: You wanna try that again, {$name}?
<<jump date_kuzan_1_FrisbeeThrow>>

The frisbee sails into {$kuzan}'s arms, only wobbling a little. He yawns as he tosses it one handed back towards you.
-> {$name}: Catch it. (0)
    You catch it! Good job! Someone is proud of you, somewhere.
-> {$name}: Catch it with [i]style[/i]. (1)
    You leap into the air, spinning like a dancer, hands outstretched! You look awesome! You are putting those bootcamp skills to use, go you! You grab it grinning, then - oops. You fumbled the landing and drop the frisbee. Don't even look at {$kuzan}. The blow to your self esteem may kill you.
{$kuzan} holds his hands up, waiting for you to toss it back. So what you gonna do, champ?

You grab the corner(?) of the frisbee, pull your arm back with great might, and swing forward! Smoothly, you release the disc and it crashes right into the ground. Yeah, not sure what your plan was there. {$kuzan} stares at you.
-> Stare back. (0)
    The wind blows, a crow caws. Time elongates. Your eyes strain with the urge to blink. You will not look away! You have to assert your dominance... somehow! It is only after a minute or two has passed that you realize {$kuzan} has fallen asleep! Oi! He wakes up when you look away.
-> Strike a pose. (1)
    It's super effective! At making you look like an idiot. {$kuzan} gives you a sort of concerned thumbs up. AWESOME.
{$kuzan}: You gonna throw it for real or…?

You limp wrist it. A gentle flick. It's a leaf upon the wind! It wobbles and sinks toward the earth. {$kuzan} looks surprised but moves forward, diving to catch it, rolling and coming back up with it in his hands. Wow, so smooth! He tosses it back towards you.
-> Try to copy his catch.
    You dive for the frisbee! Except the Admiral did not throw it gently. It hits you right in the forehead. You lay on the grass, dazed.
    {$kuzan}: You okay, {$name}?
    You get up and give him a thumbs up, trying to hide your regrets behind a bright smile.
-> Catch it regularly.
    You catch it. Aw yeah, frisbee!
// Were there supposed to be points here? All the other ones have them.
{$kuzan}: Alright, make it a challenge this time.

{$name}: Better go find those kids to give this back…
{$kuzan}: Good Luck with that, {$name}.
-> Want to help me? (0)
    {$kuzan}: This grass is pretty comfy… oh, c'mon, don't give me that look. You're still doing it. Alright fine, fine.
    You didn't give him a look…
-> As a marine, you're supposed to help people. Sir. (1)
    {$kuzan}: Sir? On my day off? Guess you're never really off duty… let's go find those kids.
// I see what you're going for here - option 1 kinda forces him, and option 2 convinces him. If I was playing blind, though, I'd expect the opposite reaction, with the first letting him choose and the second bringing work into it (which his lax side may clash with). Might just be a personal issue, but worth thinking about
-> Alright, bye Admiral Aokiji!
    <<jump date_kuzan_1_END>>

You walk around, checking the garden, the park again, the nearest popular street, even the docks! {$kuzan} tags along with you, yawning, hands in his pockets. But you don't have much luck.
{$name}: [i]sigh[/i] No sign of them.
Your stomach rumbles, loud enough to be heard by anyone nearby.
{$kuzan}: Oh well, their loss. Wanna get something to eat?
-> Oooh, you buying? With your superior Admiral paycheck and all? (1)
    {$kuzan}: I'm more than just money… but yeah sure.
-> Yeah, I could eat. (1)
    {$kuzan}: I know a noodle place, c'mon.
-> No, I'm tired and want to go home.

{$kuzan}: You did good or whatever today, by the way.
-> Did good on what? Failing to return a frisbee? (1)
    {$kuzan}: You tried to do a good thing, that counts on the… grand scale, or whatever it's called.
    -> Uh… I guess? (1)
    -> You mean like the cosmic scale? Like the concept? (2)
        {$kuzan}: Yeah, that. The little things add up, or I hope they do. I guess we don't really know, huh, {$name} Ah, the noodles are here.
    -> Still failed though. (0)
        {$kuzan}: Yeah, well, that happens.
-> Thanks. (0)
    {$kuzan}: Yep.
-> I try to do the right thing and fail… (2)
    {$kuzan}: Yeah… it's rough. Sometimes you give it your all and still don't make it.
    He looks far away and you get the feeling he isn't really talking about the frisbee.
    -> I think you did good today too, Sir. (2)
        {$kuzan}: Thanks, {$name}.
    -> Um, it's… it's just a frisbee. (0)
        {$kuzan}: …Hm.
{$kuzan}: Well, let's eat!

Your big bowl of noodles arrives, steaming hot and full to the brim. All that walking around really made you hungry! It wasn't how you intended to spend your day, but it wasn't bad. {$kuzan} even pays for lunch! With a wave, you go your separate ways.

{$kuzan}: This is more my style.
-> Um… drinking in the afternoon? (1)
    {$kuzan}: A drink after a hard day is always good.
    if has_item("TookNapWithKuzan")
        {$name}: But we only just napped???
        {$kuzan}: Yep, hard day.
-> Yes, this is how to spend a day! (2)
    {$kuzan}: I'll toast to that.
    YOU TOAST
-> Figures. (0)
    {$kuzan}: Oi. Don't be rude to your superior officer. I was gonna pay, but you can pay for your own drinks.

{$kuzan}: So what do you think of Marineford, {$name}?
-> I like it, I work hard and play hard. (0)
    {$kuzan}: Good for you.
-> There's a lot to learn. (2)
    {$kuzan}: Yeah, that's the world though. Keep it up, you're doing fine.
-> Looking forward to retirement. (1)
    {$kuzan}: Then we can nap and drink all we want, huh?

You drink and eat some bar food, smooth jazz plays in the background. The bar slowly fills up with people, soldiers and workers. Cigarette smoke fills the air overhead, and the clinking of glasses lulls you into a contemplative state. No one sits near the two of you, leaving you in a peaceful bubble.

{$kuzan}: Listen, {$name}, don't let go of your principles. This place can… change you or something. But if you stick to your guns you'll, uh… you'll… you know what I mean.
{$kuzan} taps his gloved fingers against the side of his glass, the amber liquid rippling just a little.
-> Um, I'll do my best Sir? (0)
    {$kuzan}: Good, keep it up. -Throws some money on the counter and heads out. What a strange guy.-
    <<jump date_kuzan_1_END>>
// Seems like a bit sudden of an exit
-> You're “harshing the vibes”, Sir. (2)
    {$kuzan}: -He laughs lowly and finishes his drink.- Alright, {$name}, thanks for the day. I'll see you around.
    <<jump date_kuzan_1_END>>
-> Yeah, okay, no more drinks for you. Let's get you home. (1)
    {$kuzan}: Home, been a long time since I've been there… -He looks into the bottom of his glass, eyes far away.- You're right {$name}, I'm heading out. See ya later. He tosses some money on the counter and heads out. What a strange guy.-
