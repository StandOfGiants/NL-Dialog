You decide you should see what Captain Coby is up to. You haven't seen him around the base in the past few hours, so you decide to check his office.

Sure enough, he's there and looking rather... frazzled, to say the least.

Coby: Oh! {$name}! I didn't see you there. Yes, I'm just trying to get a handle on all of this... Though now that you're here, I may take this opportunity to take a bit of a break. And please, there's no need for formalities.
-> You certainly look like you need one...
    Coby: Oh boy, do I?
    <<jump date_coby_1_Coby_choice>>

You walk with him down to the mess hall, listening to Coby's stomach growl. He said he hadn't eaten in a while, but you can't help but wonder how long â€˜a while' actually was... No wonder he wasn't getting any work done.
-> Do you know what they're serving today?
    Coby: No idea... Something good, I hope.
    <<jump date_coby_1_Coby_food2>>
-> How did you manage to forget to eat for so long?
    Coby: I tend to lose track of time while I'm working. There's usually someone to remind me, but he's had other things to do.
    {$name}: Helmeppo?
    Coby: Helmeppo...
    <<jump date_coby_1_Coby_food2>>
-> How did you end up with so much paperwork anyways?

Both of you eat in silence for a little while. The captain seems content to stay occupied with his food, but your mind wanders. If there was ever a perfect chance to get to know him better, it would be now.

<<set $cd1_possible += 1>>
-> It may be a pain, but it does have its uses. Things would be a mess without any.
    <<set $cd1_points += 1>>
    Coby: Of course. But sometimes it feels like I'm filling out the same information over and over...
    <<jump date_coby_1_Coby_food4>>
-> Yeah, the paperwork sucks. Most of the time it just feels redundant.
    Coby: It does. I don't see why departments can't just use one form so we can fill it out once and copy it...
    <<jump date_coby_1_Coby_food4>>
-> Don't you have better things to do than complain about paperwork?

Coby: Sometimes. Usually, it stays with Sengoku, but it seems to be getting a bit more adventurous lately. Especially since Drake has come back. I think it missed him a bit...
-> That's so sweet!
    Coby: Yeah. Of course, I can't exactly say if it's true or not, since I'm pretty sure Helmeppo's also been feeding it old paperwork...
    <<jump date_coby_1_Coby_food4>>

    Coby: Same here, if I'd known him that long.
    <<jump date_coby_1_Coby_food4>>

Coby: An acquired taste...
<<set $cd1_possible += 1>>

    Coby: Fair warning though, he's still pretty abrasive even when you know him.
    <<set $cd1_points += 1>>
    <<jump date_coby_1_Coby_food4>>
-> I'll take your word for it...
    Coby: That's all I can ask.

    <<jump date_coby_1_Coby_food5>>

    Coby: Understandable, it can be pretty hectic here and I know that's not for everyone.

You both finish eating and Coby sighs.
Coby: Wow, I really needed that...
Coby: I guess I should get back to work now, though, shouldn't I?

    Coby: Well I'm not about to say no to that.
