You walk over to the training grounds and look around to find a suitable spot to start stretching. It's been a while since you've managed to catch a moment alone to train, and you want to make every moment count.

As you look around the area, you notice a familiar figure sitting alone on the bleachers with a cigarette between his fingers. It's Rosinante, and as you look at him more closely, he seems to be deep in thought.

<<show_character rosinante center show>>
-> Approach him and ask what's on his mind.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_1A>>
-> Approach him and make small talk.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_1B>>
-> Maybe he's busy... It's probably a good idea to leave him alone.

{$name}: Commander, good afternoon! Is everything all right? You seem like you have a lot on your mind.
Rosinante: Hello, {$name}! I didn't expect to see you here today.
Rosinante: All is well! I'm just figuring out some last minute details for the mission I'm going on later.
{$name}: You're going on a mission later? But you seem so relaxed.
{$name}: I'm often so nervous the day I have to go out in the field.
Rosinante: Ah, I remember going through that when I was a recruit.
Rosinante: After a while, you get used to it, you know? It's just a bit more complicated now since it wasn't originally my mission. I'm just filling in for Lieutenant Gray.
-> Oh! Do you need any help? We could figure out a plan together.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_2A>>
-> Are you going by yourself?
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_2B>>
-> That sounds like important work. I won't bother you anymore, Commander.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_1C>>

title: date_rosinante_1_Part_2A

Rosinante: There's no need. I'm already in a hurry, but I just wanted to figure out some last minute details. I'll be good. I always work better when I'm already in action, anyway.
-> Are you going by yourself?
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_2B>>

    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_1C>>

title: date_rosinante_1_Part_2B

Rosinante: Yes, that's my speciality.
{$name}: Isn't it difficult? What if something happens to you and you're all alone?
Rosinante: That's something that comes with the job, isn't it? Even if you have a partner, you can't always rely on them and expect them to get you out of trouble.
Rosinante: They've got their own part of the mission to worry about. Camaraderie and teamwork are very important in the Marines, but at the end of the day, for all that to work, each individual needs to do their own part.

You'd never thought about it that way. You knew Rosinante was capable, given how often he was praised, but now that you can talk to him, you finally realize how important experience is in this line of work.

{$name}: You're right. I suppose solo missions are unavoidable, then. But if it were me, I would still prefer a partner.
Rosinante: Everyone has their own style. For me, it's a lot simpler to go alone, given my Devil Fruit powers.
-> The Calm-Calm Fruit, right? Could you tell me more about it? I'm not sure how it works.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_3A>>
-> Even if you have your Devil Fruit, I still find it impressive that you can work so efficiently by yourself. It looks like I've got a lot to learn. (+1 point)
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_3B>>
===

title: date_rosinante_1_Part_3A

Rosinante: Oh! It's very simple, actually. When I snap my fingers &&like this&& I create a bubble around me that can either stop all sound from getting in or the sound I make from getting out. It's really useful for stealth missions! I can even do this for other people if I want to.
Rosinante: Maybe you won't think it's all that amazing - [i]someone[/i] I know certainly doesn't - but even a "weak" Devil Fruit can be useful in the right hands.
-> I completely agree, Commander! Mastering a Devil Fruit is certainly no easy feat and the one you described sounds really handy in your line of work. (+ 1 Point)
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_3B>>
-> Hmm, I have a question. I know it may not seem appropriate given our previous discussion, but would it be alright if I tagged along on the mission? I am not so familiar with stealth missions and I wish to learn more.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_3C>>

Unexpectedly, the commander seems shy after hearing your praise.

Rosinante: Truly, it's nothing. It's not that impressive.
Rosinante: Hey, why don't you come along? I think it would be a great opportunity for a recruit to learn new things.
Rosinante: Tsuru-san speaks highly of you; I'm sure you can handle this.
-> Of course! I would never miss an opportunity like this.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_4A>>
-> I'm sorry, Commander. Thank you for the offer, but I wouldn't want to drag you down. Maybe after I gain more experience.

As you had expected, the commander is surprised by your question. He seems to think about it for a few seconds before giving you a response.
Rosinante: Sure, I don't see why not. I've heard good things about you; you should be able to handle it.
<<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_4A>>

The commander is shocked by your comment. For the first time since you met him, he looks annoyed.
Rosinante: Right...
Rosinante: I'd better get going. Goodbye, {$name}.
<<jump date_rosinante_1_DateEnds>>

The commander is busy, so you shouldn't distract him with making conversation anymore. You say goodbye and return to your training.

{$name}: Good afternoon, Commander.
Rosinante: Hello, {$name}! I didn't expect to see you here today.
{$name}: Yes... I've got a bit of free time and I decided to come train alone.
{$name}: I enjoy it a lot more than training with the group; it's more relaxing.

You lean in closer and put a hand near your mouth to hide your next words from any onlookers.

{$name}: Although, don't tell Tsuru-san I've got free time. She'll put me to work right away.
Rosinante: Tsuru-san is great, but I agree - she works so much.
{$name}: That's how she got to her position. It would have been impossible without working as hard as she does. I respect it, but I still need time for myself.
Rosinante: Of course; we all need a break once in a while.
-> Are you taking a break too? Is that why you're at the training grounds?
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_5A>>
-> With weather like this, who wouldn't want to take a break from work?
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_5B>>
-> Exactly, but are you having a break right now as well, Commander? Won't you get in trouble if you just sit here and do nothing?
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_5C>>
===

title: date_rosinante_1_Part_5A

Rosinante: Ah, no. I wish I was taking a break. I'm just figuring out some last minute details for the mission I'm going on later.
{$name}: You're going on a mission later? But you seem so relaxed.
{$name}: I'm often so nervous the day I have to go out in the field.

Rosinante: Really? Isn't it too hot, though?
{$name}: For me, it's perfect.
{$name}: If I may ask, where are you from, Commander?
Rosinante: Ah...
Rosinante: Let's just say I grew up in North Blue.
{$name}: Then it makes sense! You prefer colder weather, right? I'm from South Blue, so I prefer warmer weather.
Rosinante: I've never thought about it like that, but you're right; it makes sense.
Rosinante: Wasn't it hard for you to leave your island and move here? I've noticed a lot of recruits tend to be homesick during their first months.
{$name}: I can't say I don't miss it, but it's been a while since I left and I got used to things.
{$name}: I still have to get used to how rowdy Marine bases are, though... back at home I lived on a small island and it was so much quieter.
Rosinante: Heh, you're right. It's hard to find a quiet place around here. That's the reason why I'm at the training grounds outside of schedule, too.
Rosinante: But one thing that I can tell you is that it's also quite hard to get lonely, as well. You'll be fine here.
Rosinante smiles warmly before gasping softly and facepalming. The action surprises you and you take a step back.
{$name}: Is everything alright, Commander?
Rosinante: I can't just be sitting here and chatting; I've got a mission to go on.
{$name}: A mission? Right now?
Rosinante: Not right now, but very soon. I need to get ready.
-> Are you going by yourself?
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_2B>>
-> That sounds like important work. I won't bother you anymore, Commander.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_1C>>

Rosinante: I'm not taking a break, but even if I was, there is hardly anyone around here to get me in trouble.
Rosinante: Although, if I'm not careful around Tsuru-san, I wouldn't be surprised if she made me sweep the floors as if I was a recruit again.
{$name}: If you're not taking a break, then what are you doing?
Rosinante: I'm thinking! The training grounds are quiet at this hour. I'm just figuring out some last minute details for the mission I'm going on later.
{$name}: You're going on a mission later? But you seem so relaxed.
{$name}: I'm often so nervous the day I have to go out in the field.

You and Rosinante climb onto the enemy ship hidden away in an unused area of the port. Before you begin the mission, Rosinante uses his power to envelop you both in a silent bubble.
<<show_character rosinante center show>>
Rosinante: Alright, {$name}. Now that we're here, I'll tell you the plan.
Rosinante: Our purpose is to find some stolen Marine information. These mercenaries were hired to find [i]something[/i] in the base, and unfortunately, they were successful. We need to figure out exactly what type of information was stolen, get it back, and more importantly, find out who hired these people.
{$name}: That seems simple enough.
Rosinante: Are you ready?
-> I'm sorry, Commander, but I feel nervous about this.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_6A>>
-> Let's do this!
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_6B>>
-> What is the plan?
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_6B>>
===

title: date_rosinante_1_Part_6A

Rosinante: That's alright. Listen, I can't promise everything will go smoothly, but I know you are capable. If you follow the plan, everything should be fine.
Rosinante: Plus, I'm here with you. I promise to protect you no matter what happens.
-> You're right! I don't know what I was afraid of. I'm ready.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_6B>>
-> I trust you, Commander. But what if I mess up? This is embarrassing to admit, but I don't want to be all alone.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_6C>>
-> I'm sorry, Commander, but that doesn't help me at all! I should have never come along.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_6D>>
===

title: date_rosinante_1_Part_6B

Rosinante: I love your enthusiasm!
Rosinante: Alright, here is the plan. First, you go towards the Captain's quarters and find the stolen information while I figure out who they want to sell it to.
Rosinante: Be careful not to be seen. If you find any enemies, it's better that you continue towards your destination without getting distracted.
Rosinante: I'll set a time limit of ten minutes, and we'll both whistle once the time is up. We'll meet up back on deck soon after. If one of us doesn't respond to the whistle, we have to assume the other person got captured and we continue on with the mission.
-> Understood! Let's do it.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_7B>>
-> I have a better plan!
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_7C>>
-> Isn't it dangerous to split up? I hate to admit this, but I don't want to go by myself.
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_6C>>
===

title: date_rosinante_1_Part_6C

Rosinante: Alright! You won't have to go alone.
Rosinante: I meant for us to split up, but it's fine if you don't want to do that.
Rosinante: It's your first mission like this... I should have thought it through. It's my bad.
{$name}: No, no, Commander. It's my own fault for not being capable enough.
Rosinante: None of that! You're still learning - it's alright to have fears, you know?
Rosinante: How else would you overcome them?
Rosinante smiles and your chest is filled with warmth. You realise you're so lucky to have someone like him to guide you on this mission.
Rosinante: Now, here is the plan. We sneak off together towards the Captain's quarters. The information must be there. Once we are done, we will figure out who they want to sell it to.
Rosinante: I'll focus on the information, and you keep an eye out for any enemies.
{$name}: Understood!
<<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_7A>>
===

title: date_rosinante_1_Part_6D
---
Rosinante: That's alright...
Rosinante: You still have enough time to learn. The mission hasn't started yet; you can leave if that's what you want.
{$name}: I'm sorry to disappoint you, Commander.
Rosinante: You still have enough time to learn. Get stronger, and next time, I'll take you on another mission!
{$name}: I appreciate that, thank you. I will do better next time.
You quietly sneak off the ship and return back to the Marine base.
<<jump date_rosinante_1_DateEnds>>
===

title: date_rosinante_1_Part_7C
---

{$name}: I think one of us should act as a distraction while the other finds the information. This way, the person going after the information won't run into any enemies.
Rosinante: I see your point, but that defeats the whole purpose of a stealth mission.
Rosinante: Don't forget, we have two objectives here. We also need to find who needs this information. Don't forget that.
Rosinante: I think it's better we stick to my plan for now.
Rosinante: Next time, I'll let you figure out the plan.

Rosinante has an encouraging smile on his face, but you feel embarrassed for being refused like this. Avoiding his gaze, you nod.

{$name}: I understand, Commander.
<<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_7B>>

Rosinante: I will create a Calm bubble on myself. As long as you don't leave my side, your movements won't be heard either.
{$name}: Understood.

You and Rosinante sneak below deck. The two of you look around for a bit until you suddenly hear some voices and you stop in your tracks.
Unnamed mercenary 1: So, did the boss tell you anything?
Unnamed mercenary 2: Nothing of importance, but I did hear something from Matthew. Come a bit closer; I don't want to get in trouble for this.
{$name}: Commander, I think we can make out whatever they're saying if we approach their area.
Rosinante: Good idea.
You begin to approach when suddenly, you notice someone sneaking up behind you.
-> You are too afraid to act. (-1 point)
    <<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_9A>>
-> Leave Rosinante's side and attack the enemy.

You freeze in fear. Rosinante notices, but it is too late. Suddenly, you feel striking pain at the back of your head.

Without any time to react, you fall to the ground and pass out.
<<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_8D>>

The voices get louder as the enemy behind you approaches. Your would-be assailant doesn't realize you had noticed him.

Unnamed mercenary 1: Really? That clown?
Unnamed mercenary 2: Not so loud! I don't want the boss to hear that I told you.
Unnamed mercenary 1: The boss isn't even here; he won't know. But are you serious? Is it really Buggy the Clown? What does he even want wi-

They get interrupted by a loud sound. It is you tackling your attacker to the ground. You manage to knock him out, only belatedly realizing how much noise you'd made.
Rosinante: Run!

The two of you dash through the empty ship until you find the Captain's quarters.
Rosinante: Find the information!
Rosinante locks the door behind him while you begin rummaging through the drawers. The mercenaries soon find you and begin violently hitting the door in order to break it down.
{$name}: Found it!
You snatch the notebook with the information, which seems to be on new Marine recruits, and Rosinante nods. He opens the door and begins fighting the mercenaries. You run up to help, and soon the two of you manage to escape the ship.
<<jump date_rosinante_1_Part_8E>>

title: date_rosinante_1_Part_9C

{$name}: Commander, there is an enemy behind us.
Rosinante nods without showing any reaction. The attacker approaches and you feel anxious with every passing moment that Rosinante doesn't do anything. You consider attacking, but before you can, Rosinante turns around sharply and grabs the enemy in a chokehold. Soon, he passes out.
Rosinante: Good eye, {$name}.

The two of you keep walking until you are close enough to hear the voices more clearly.

Unnamed mercenary 1: Really? That clown?
Unnamed mercenary 2: Not so loud! I don't want the boss to hear that I told you.
Unnamed mercenary 1: The boss isn't even here; he won't know. But are you serious? Is it really Buggy the Clown? What does he even want with this info?
Unnamed mercenary 2: Who knows... But be quiet about this. If I find out you told someone, I'll beat you up.
Unnamed mercenary 1: I'm sure that's what Matthew told you as well, hahahaha!

You and Rosinante move away from the mercenaries as you have heard what you needed to hear and continue towards the Captain's quarters.
{$name}: Buggy the Warlord?
Rosinante: I guess so. I don't know another Buggy the Clown.
{$name}: Why would he want to steal information from the Marines? Is he planning something?
Leisurely, the two of you enter the Captain's quarters and begin rummaging through the drawers.
Rosinante: Maybe. Or maybe he wants to sell it to others.
Rosinante: He's got a lot of businesses going on right now.
{$name}: I'm not sure which option is scarier...
{$name}: Found it!
You pick up the notebook with the information, which seems to be on new Marine recruits, and Rosinante nods. The two of you leave the ship, careful not to be noticed.

You walk along the lower decks, keeping your eyes peeled for any movement around you.
{$name}: Okay, {$name}, you can't mess this up.
{$name}: Captain's quarters... Captain's quarters...

You look around for a bit until you suddenly hear some voices, causing you to stop in your tracks. They're faint, but you think you can make out whatever they're saying if you approach them.
Unnamed mercenary 1: So, did the boss tell you anything?
Unnamed mercenary 2: Nothing of importance, but I did hear something from Matthew. Come a bit closer; I don't want to get in trouble for this.

They continue to speak in lowered voices that you can't hear from your current position.
{$name}: Ugh, what should I do? I only have ten minutes to find the information...

You can't believe you've wasted so much time already. You hurry through the lower decks until you find the Captain's quarters. Thankfully, no one is guarding it.

You rummage through the drawers, keeping your focus on the door to make sure no one comes in. Suddenly, you hear a whistle above you.
{$name}: Oh no. The commander is done. I have to hurry.
After a couple more minutes of searching, you find a notebook. Looking through it, you realise it's information on new Marine recruits. You snatch it and whistle while running past the door.
