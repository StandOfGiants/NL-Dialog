Laying in your room, you stare at the transponder snail in complete boredom. You should feel grateful for the break you get, but after such exciting days, you just feel restless. Maybe grabbing a bite of food will alleviate some of that restlessness.

Walking around aimlessly, you come across a noodle stand, surprisingly cozy. It smells really good too… but while you're approaching it, you spot someone familiar in line.
<<show_characters issho>>
{$name}: {$issho}?!
{$issho}: Ah, {$name}! Have you come to eat as well? The food is excellent here.
-> Is there anything you recommend?
    {$issho}: The udon and soba here are a great choice. They're my favorites.
    Udon and soba, huh? That sounds good, too.
    {$name}: I'll have whatever the Admiral is having please.
    The food is delicious. It's warm, comforting food. You enjoy it very much. You note down the address — perhaps you will visit it again.
    <<jump date_issho_1_Part_2>>
-> Well a stall is a bit too common for me... I prefer something with more class.
    {$issho}: Is that so? I suppose I consider having class something different than how luxurious something looks.
    {$name}: Oh, well, I would like to try whatever is good on the menu then.
    As {$issho} said, the food is good. You feel a bit embarrassed for having judged it too harshly.

You feel relaxed after finishing your meal. {$issho} is amicable, and he smiles a lot. You both pay for your respective meals and leave the stall.
{$issho}: Do you have any plans for the rest of the day?
-> Let's head to the park! The day is nice!
    <<jump date_issho_1_Part_2A>>
-> Let's walk and talk!
    <<jump date_issho_1_Part_2B>>

You stand all proud after your joke. A second passes before {$issho} chuckles, amused by it.
Oh! He likes your joke! You know what joke to say next then!
-> Okay, I have a better one for you... the weather today's windy. It sure blows!
    <<set $isd1_points += 1>>

{$issho}: A boring old man like me? Thank you for your offer. I can just sit at the bench. You go ahead, {$name}.
You leave Issho at the bench before joining the kids with a cheerful wave. They are indeed looking for an extra playmate. You're playing for a bit, but then…
<<start_effect shake>>
[shake]SNAP![/shake]
A kite's line snaps, causing it to snag on a tree. Uh oh. What should you do now?
-> You're a Marine with proper training! The least you can do is to climb that tree to help a kid!
    <<set $isd1_points += 1>>
    <<set $isd1_points += 1>>
    Swiftly making your way up the tree, you reach for the kite to the children's cheering. Your happiness is short-lived when the branch you are standing on snaps under your weight.
    You squeeze your eyes shut, expecting to hit the ground with great impact but the pain never comes. Opening your eyes, you find yourself floating down gently, {$issho} slowing your fall.
    {$issho}: [comment]smile[/comment] Be careful, {$name}.
    <<jump date_issho_1_Part_2A3>>
-> Why should you do anything when you can just ask {$issho} for help?
    <<set $isd1_points -= 1>>
    You tell the kids to wait for you while you go back to the Admiral.
    {$name}: Sir, can you help us with a stuck kite? The line snaps and I really don't like climbing trees. It's such a hassle! You have a really useful power to help us out!
    {$issho}: [comment]surprised[/comment] Alright.
    With {$issho}'s help, the kite is easily unstuck and brought back to ground level. The children cheer happily.
    You beam. A good deed without having to expend energy! {$issho}'s brow furrows, though. Perhaps he'd thought you were more... resourceful.
    <<jump date_issho_1_Part_2A3>>
-> You probably should leave it. The kid's parents are going to get them a new kite anyway.
    <<set $isd1_points -= 1>>
    <<set $isd1_points -= 1>>
    Ignoring the kids' cry, you return to {$issho}'s side.
    {$issho}: Did you have fun?
    {$name}: It went okay, but then the kids started crying. I'm a Marine, not a babysitter.

{$issho} seems to be listening, but he doesn't react visibly either way. You take that as a good sign to continue your idea.
You hide behind a tree, waiting for the unsuspecting children to run past you before jumping out with a shout.
{$name}: [shake]BOOO!!![/shake]
The kids shriek in fear, some running into you in their panic.
You laugh at the harmless fun. Watching them untangle themselves from you, you decide that you should:
-> Apologize and help the kids up
    {$name}: Sorry, kiddos. Hope I didn't scare you too badly. Here, your kites.
    You go back to Issho, grinning widely.
    <<jump date_issho_1_Part_2A3>>
-> Yell at them for running into you
    <<set $isd1_points -= 1>>
    <<set $isd1_points -= 1>>
    {$name}: Watch where you're going, brats! Want me to tell your parents?!
    The kids scramble away in fear. You return to Issho's side, but he doesn't look very happy.
    {$issho}: [comment]frown[/comment] That wasn't very nice.
    <<jump date_issho_1_Part_2A3>>
-> Bully them to take their kites. You want to fly kites but you don't want annoying kids!
    <<set $isd1_points -= 1>>
    <<set $isd1_points -= 1>>
    {$name}: Give me your kites or I'm going to arrest you. Look at me, I'm a Marine. If you aren't nice to me you will go to jail.
    The kids sob but give their kites to you. Ha! You know scaring people with your rank works every time. You run back to Issho with the kites, hoping he might want to join you now. He is frowning, though.
    Did you... do something wrong?

Before you have the chance to say anything else, you hear loud shouting from a different corner of the park.
A one-sided scuffle has broken out between a civilian and a group of Marines.
Your training kicks in and you run toward the sounds.
<<show_character placeholder("Marine">>, a, show)
<<show_character placeholder("Civilian">>, d, show)
There's a civilian on the ground, holding his aching cheek. A group of five other Marines tower over him, laughing. He throws a flailing, uncoordinated fist but is immediately kicked in the face.
Marine: Hahaha, shouldn't have put up a resistance. Who do you think you are? You're only living so well thanks to our protection.
{$name}: What's going on here?
Marine: Petty Officer?! This person right there is trying to pick a fight with us! It's self defense!
Civilian: N-No! They're lying! They were demanding protection money from me! I swear I'm telling the truth!
You look at the two sides. It's clear to you what the right decision is:
-> Protect civilian
    <<set $isd1_points += 1>>
    <<set $isd1_points += 1>>

You boldly step between the two sides, standing with your back facing the hurt civilian.
{$name}: Have you guys no shame?! You are obviously bullying this man! This is unacceptable behavior! I'll report you if you don't leave him alone. Now!
Marine: Why won't you trust us? We are on the same side!
{$issho}: I sense trouble. <smile> Is there anything I should know?
Marine: Oh crap, {$issho}! Um, no troubles! We're just leaving! Good bye!
<<hide_character placeholder("Marine">>, hide)
{$name}: Cowards.
You explain to {$issho} about what you saw. He looks stern for a moment, before smiling at the part where you stood up for the right things. {$issho} apologizes to the civilian on the Marines' behalf, promising he'll get to fixing what's broken.
<<hide_character placeholder("Civilian">>, hide)
You smile as well. You feel like you have done an amazing job.

You aren't paid enough to deal with this. You immediately turn tail and run toward {$issho}.
{$name}: There's a fight going on between a civilian and a bunch of Marines, sir! Please stop them. I don't want to do it!
{$issho}: [comment]frown[/comment] I'm aware of the situation. I'll deal with it accordingly. <pause> Thank you, {$name}.
Relieved, you hide behind {$issho} the whole time as he deals with the group of Marines, sounding exactly like how an Admiral should sound. He's really cool!
Once he has finished chastising those Marines, {$issho} bows low to the hurt civilian. You watch the guy leave, hoping that his opinion on the Navy hasn't changed.
<<hide_character placeholder("Marine">>, hide)
<<hide_character placeholder("Civilian">>, hide)

You huff, crossing your arms, joining the group of Marines while the civilian tears up.
{$name}: Hey, don't be a jerk to us! We save you from pirates, we can easily kick your ass, too!
Marine: Bawahaha! See? We are the righteous ones and you are just trash.
{$issho}: [comment]smiles[/comment] Now, now... That is not a very nice thing to say... is it? Not the kind of things I expected to hear from Marines.
{$name}: Ad-{$issho}?!
But {$issho} doesn't look at you at all. You have the feeling you have disappointed him.
{$issho}: Leave. You have truly failed your vow. This park is a very nice place, and I don't want it tainted by your presence. Proper punishment will await you tomorrow. Think about what you did.
{$issho} apologizes to the civilian, still not addressing you. You want to apologize but you feel ashamed of how you acted. Perhaps you have ruined today's outing with your unwise choice.

    {$issho}: [comment]smile[/comment] That they can be, yes. There are battles not worth picking though. Protecting my pride by showing off is one of those.
-> I don't think I can make an accurate assessment yet. Perhaps if we spend more time together...?
    {$issho}: <pause> [comment]Smile[/comment] Perhaps if we run into each other again in the future.
-> I'm sure you're really strong! But you don't have a Logia…
    <<set $isd1_points -= 1>>
    {$issho}: [comment]frown[/comment] Having a Logia — or eyesight, for that matter — doesn't grant strength. Sometimes, it's the arrogant Logia that gets defeated first.

{$issho}: [comment]smile[/comment] Interesting question. There's actually a form of touch language you can use to read words without sight.
{$name}: Touch language? You can read by touch?
{$issho}: Would you like to learn? I can teach you. It's very interesting.
-> Really?! You'd teach me? I'd love to!

    {$issho}: [comment]smile[/comment] I'm glad to hear you are so enthusiastic. I'll teach it to you later.
-> Maybe another time, sir. I'm still a bit overwhelmed by everything right now.
    {$issho}: Fair enough. In that case, focusing on yourself first is good.
-> Learning a whole new language just to [i]read[/i]? I'll pass. Thank you for your offer, Admiral.
    <<set $isd1_points -= 1>>
    {$issho}: What a pity. I suppose learning a new language is quite intimidating.

{$issho}: I have heard the same thing from the many pirates I've captured over the years.
{$issho}: [comment]frown[/comment] Underestimating people like that can get you in serious trouble.
-> M-My apologies... that was out of line…
    {$issho}: It was. The world is full of people who are powerful but don't look like it.
-> I'm not worried. I'm a desk jockey! I'll be fine!
    <<set $isd1_points -= 1>>
    {$issho}: Just because you don't think you'll be on the front line doesn't mean that a fight won't come to you eventually.

{$name}: I don't really have any plans. I was just really bored sitting at home.
{$issho}: Life at Marineford is very exciting, isn't it? I understand how a day off feels so jarring in comparison.
{$issho}: [comment]smile[/comment] In that case, would you like to take a stroll with me?
-> I'm up for that! It'll be a nice distraction!
    <<jump date_issho_1_Part_2B>>

You were expecting {$issho} to be ecstatic about work just as much as you are, but perhaps that is something more in line with the Fleet Admiral. There's not any immediate reaction, but you quickly realize you've picked the wrong activity.
{$issho}: Ah, I've completed my duty for the day. It's rare to get days off so I prefer to enjoy it fully. Have fun with your work, {$name}. I'm sure Saka would appreciate having another hard working helper.
{$name}: Oh, okay... see you around, Admiral. Have a good day!

    You two spend the rest of the day together, talking about anything and everything. {$issho} is a very attentive listener, and a good conversationalist. At last, even good things must end. This is where you two part ways.
    {$name}: Ah, it's getting pretty late. I should get going.
    {$issho}: [comment]Smile[/comment] Thank you for keeping me company, {$name}. I enjoyed our conversation very much.
    {$issho}: I'll see you around. Maybe next time, you can show me your favorite place to eat.
    -> You got it, Admiral! See you at work tomorrow!
        {$issho}: I'll hold you to it.
        {$issho} smiles at you before you both part ways. Wow, what a day!
    -> Perhaps when my schedule permits it, I'm still settling down. Good bye, {$issho}.
        {$issho}: Of course.
        You watch {$issho} leave, the sounds of his cane light. He's really an interesting man.
    <<romance_points issho 2>>
elif is_greater_than("isd1.points", 2)
    The conversation flows easily afterward. There were a few moments where you almost said the wrong thing but caught yourself. {$issho} is a patient man. You are really glad you got to spend time with him today.
    {$name}: Thank you for spending time with me today, sir! It was a lot of fun!
    {$issho}: [comment]smile[/comment] The pleasure was mine. I look forward to working with you more in the future.
    {$issho} waves at you briefly before you go your separate ways. You really look forward to tomorrow's work! Maybe you can come across the Admiral again!
    <<romance_points issho 2>>
elif is_greater_than("isd1.points", 0)
    Afterward, you spend a little longer talking. There are a few small hiccups here and there. Some you catch; others, you speak without thinking which often ends in awkward pauses. It could be worse. You feel like you make very little progress towards knowing {$issho}.
    {$issho}: I'll see you at work tomorrow, {$name}.
    {$name}: Yes, sir. I'll try my best at work!
    {$issho} nods with a smile. You watch him leave before going home yourself. Tomorrow is going to be a busy day!
    <<romance_points issho 1>>

    There's now a tense awkwardness between you two. You want to start a conversation, but you don't know how to. {$issho} doesn't treat you badly, but there's no chemistry between you two either. After another fifteen minute of futility…
    {$issho}: I should leave. I have a few more tasks to attend to.
    So soon? Don't you want to hang out some more?
    -> As pleasant as today has been, I will have to cut it short, unfortunately. Maybe another time.
    -> Um, see ya, Admiral. Thank you for the day.
    {$issho} nods politely. You watch him as he leaves. Perhaps you'll be more prepared next time you talk to him...
