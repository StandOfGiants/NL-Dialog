It is the start of another workday. You decide to get to HQ early.
On the way there, you check your notes for today.
{$name}: Tsuru's subordinates on duty today are...
{$name}: Captain Mei for reconnaissance... Ensign Malina... for guarding duty...
<<show_character tsuru center show>>
You notice that Lady Tsuru is already there. Is she meditating?
Tsuru: ...
Tsuru: Good morning, {$name}. I see you're early.
Tsuru: I apologize for the chaos yesterday. It must've been stressful for a first-timer here.
-> It's okay. I like a challenge. (+)
    <<jump date_tsuru_1_route1>>
-> It's what I expected from the Navy. (-)
    <<jump date_tsuru_1_route1_alt>>
-> It was a little bit confusing...
    <<jump date_tsuru_1_route2>>
-> route 3 access??? // Assuming route 3 is started here, but I don't have a trigger for it

Tsuru: Very well.
Tsuru: Being confident will do you good. You'll need to stand your ground when dealing with some of the personalities around here.
Tsuru: Especially nowadays.
-> Can you elaborate? (-)
    Tsuru: As I trust you know, the Navy is divided between very different ideologies.
    Tsuru: The ideals you adscribe will determine how you act. Some will try to sway you in their direction...
    Tsuru: Some forget that we are all one and the same.
    Tsuru: You should know this already, {$name}!
-> I hope I'll do a great job, like you!
    Tsuru: I appreciate the sentiment.
    Tsuru: But you shouldn't put anybody on a pedestalâ€”not even me.
-> Was it ever different? (+)
    Tsuru: ...very good question.
    Tsuru: If there was ever any unity in the Marines, it must have been during the Golden Era of piracy.
    Tsuru: Things aren't the same now.

Before you are able to say anything, you hear the sound of boots storming toward the garden.
It's two of Tsuru's subordinates.
<<show_character placeholder("Marine1">>, left, show)
<<show_character placeholder("Marine2">>, right, show)
Marine1: Lady Tsuru! {$name}!
Marine2: Sorry for the interruption, ma'am, but we have a problem!
-> What's the matter? (+)
    Marine1: Well, you see...
-> Don't worry about interrupting.
    Marine1: Huh... Thanks?!
    Tsuru: What's the matter?
-> You haven't been addressed. You shouldn't talk. (-)
    Tsuru: Tell us what the matter is.
Marine1: You see, Inspector Sengoku's goat...
Tsuru: ...
Marine2: Which seemed to be in quite a bad mood...
Marine1: They ate our schedules, Ma'am!
Marine1: Now we don't know where we are posted. We need your help.
-> I can help!
    Tsuru: Well, then...
    Marine1: Thank you!
    <<jump date_tsuru_1_route1_interruption_quiz1>>
-> How irresponsible of you!
    Tsuru: That is true.
    Tsuru: I assume you have kept an eye on the schedules as I told you, haven't you, {$name}?
    <<jump date_tsuru_1_route1_interruption_quiz2>>
-> I don't remember anything about today's schedule.
    Tsuru: I see.
    Tsuru: Perhaps we'd better go to the office early, then.
    {$name}: (We went upstairs, we all had to start work earlier than usual.)

Phew! You managed to help her.
After dismissing her subordinates, you still have some time, so the two of you don't have to rush making your way to the office.
Once there, Tsuru seems content...
Tsuru: I am happy to see you live up to your confidence, {$name}.
Tsuru: But don't let your guard down.
-> Of course not!
-> I have the best teacher! (+)
    Tsuru: Well, well.
    Tsuru: You don't need to flatter me.
Tsuru: Would you like some tea, before we get started?
-> Yes!
-> Of course!

Tsuru: It's what you expected? What does that mean, {$name}?
-> Everyone says the Navy is chaotic! (-)
    Tsuru: How can you say that so cheerfully?!
    Tsuru: Think before you speak!
-> Ah, nothing...
    Tsuru: ...
    Tsuru: We will see how this develops.
    Tsuru: You need to take your duty seriously!
-> I apologise if I offended you!
    Tsuru: ...
    Tsuru: Well, then.
    Tsuru: Garp, Sengoku, and I think we made the right choice to have you here. Don't disappoint us.

    Tsuru: You need more confidence if you're to work with them.

    {$name}: (Tsuru smiled!)
Tsuru: Say, {$name}. I think joining me in meditation could help you feel more grounded. What do you think?

... It seems like they're gone again.
After a few minutes of deep concentration, you end the exercise.
Tsuru: Very good. What did you think?

    Tsuru: I was hoping you would find so.
    Tsuru: I am happy with your performance, {$name}. A will to improve is important.

Snail: H-hello, Lady Tsuru!!
Snail: We had a problem with our schedules. It had to do with Inspector Sengoku's goat...
Tsuru: What? Has that thing learned to climb up walls already?
She is signaling for her papers.
-> Give all of them to her.
    Tsuru: Good.
    Tsuru still has to sort through all of the information alone...
-> I don't know exactly which info she needs... (-)
    Tsuru: {$name}, don't only stare! Get started with the work for today.
