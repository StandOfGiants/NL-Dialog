//  Sengoku date
//  Shoppig for cora
A beautiful day at Headquarters. The streets are bustling, vendors hawking their wares, the bright flag of the Navy flying overhead. A great day to wander! You pass a few clothing shops, a pet store, a jewelry store, and a bookstore. Wait a second. Is that…?
Sengoku: Oh, hello {$name}.
-> Whoa the Fleet Admiral is out of the office! (-)
    Sengoku: -grimaces- Retired Fleet Admiral. And I do have a life outside work, {$name}.
    -> Could have fooled me. (-)
        Sengoku: …
        Sengoku: I can order you to go into the office right now.
    -> Ah, yeah, sorry.
        Sengoku: It's alright. I suppose I cannot blame you for noticing my dedication to my duties. He looks contemplative and stares up at the sign above the bookstore and frowns.
    <<jump date_sengoku_2_sengoku_is_concern>>
-> Hello Sengoku-san! (++)
    Sengoku: Out shopping, {$name}?
    {$name}: Out seeing the sights, enjoying the beautiful day! What about you?
    Sengoku: Yes, though I am not seeing the sights so much as trying to accomplish something…He looks contemplative and stares up at the sign above the bookstore and frowns.
    <<jump date_sengoku_2_sengoku_is_concern>>
-> Uh… hi, Sir. (+)
    Sengoku: No need to be so formal, we're off duty, {$name}.
    {$name}: Oh right. Sorry Sir. Er, I mean Sengoku-san.
    Sengoku: -smile- Nice day to be out isn't it?
    -> Ask him what he's up to
        {$name}: Yep, are you shopping Sengoku-san?
        Sengoku: …Yes, though it is proving difficult. He looks contemplative and stares up at the sign above the bookstore and frowns.
        <<jump date_sengoku_2_sengoku_is_concern>>

        Sengoku: Call me Sengoku when we are off duty if you please. And no, nothing is wrong per say, but…
        {$name}: But? //  test
        Sengoku: I am having a bit of trouble with something. I need a gift for Rosinante, his birthday is coming up. -sigh- But I have no clue what to get him.
        -> Offer to help him (++)
            <<jump date_sengoku_2_GIFT_HUNT>>

{$name}: Would you like some help?
Sengoku: -surprise- Actually, yes. I would appreciate that.
{$name}: Okay let's find that gift! Did you have any ideas in mind?
Sengoku: No, that is the trouble. I was hoping one of the shops here would inspire me.

    {$name}: Let's check the bookstore. The two of you enter the shop. It smells like ink and paper and a little bit of coffee. The store is a little chaotic, aisles of book shelves somewhat like a forest.

    {$name}: Let's check out that clothing shop! The shop smells like leather and textiles. Mannequins show off the latest outfits and suits. An attendant stares at the two of you, rubbing their hands together.

-> General Store <<if !$found_lighter>>
    {$name}: When in doubt, check out a place with a lot of different things! The general store apparently named Wapol Emporium, is cluttered with tchokies, shoes, kitchen appliances, fabric, and many other things. And people. A LOT of people.

    You wander down the aisles on the left side of the store. A lot of books on nature, adventure stories, and history.
    {$name}: Do you think Rosinante would like any of these?
    Sengoku: Hmm… he used to enjoy those Sora Warrior of the Sea stories when he was younger.
    -> Grab a collection of Sora Warrior of the Sea
        {$name}: Those are always good, and look! They have a brand new collection which has all the volumes from the last five years!
        Sengoku: Hmm… Perhaps. He is no longer a child though, and may appreciate something else. Let's bring it with us for now.

PC:
This is the right gift, I'm sure. (-)
Sengoku: Hm…perhaps you are right. I will get this for Rosinante. Thank you for your input, {$name}.
He gives you a wave and heads off, leaving you to the rest of your day.

-> The shirts and jackets <<if !$found_jacket>>
    Jackets of all shapes and colors hang from hangers. Shirts sit nicely folded on shelves. It smells like opportunities and detergent.
    {$name}: Okay, see anything?
    Sengoku: Rosinante goes through clothing faster than anyone I have ever known, save Garp. Though Garp's mishaps involve less fire.
    {$name}: Alright let's see…
    -> Grab a jacket whose label says FIRE PROOF in bright red letters
        {$name}: Huh, speaking of fire, this here is a fire proof jacket! You tug a black jacket off a hanger, holding it up.

Attendant: Excellent, I have just the thing. He disappears for a few moments. Sengoku looks a little…uncomfortable.
Attendant: This is sure to bring joy to any beloved child! It is all the rage these days. In their hands is… a pink feather boa.
Sengoku: … No. Never. We'll keep looking by ourselves. Thank you. He walks away.

    Blankets, paper goods, and oddly enough, lighters grace the back shelves. Seems like a fire hazard but okay.
    {$name}: Anything sparking the imagination back here?
    Sengoku: You know, I gave him a lighter when he graduated from the academy, but unfortunately, he lost it on his last assignment. Perhaps I could replace it.
    {$name}: Let's look!
    -> A simple lighter with a Navy Logo
        {$name}: This one is a great brand. Free refills for life and you can get it engraved!
