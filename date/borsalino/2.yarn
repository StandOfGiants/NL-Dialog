You walk alongside Borsalino to his office.
It's worn and lived-in, full of interesting little trinkets and neatly stacked books…
But the desk is a mess!
{$borsalino}: Shall we have coffee first…?
-> No coffee. Let's get to work. (-)
    {$borsalino}: …
    {$borsalino} disappears in a flash of light and reappears with a coffee.
// This is hilarious, but could he really make coffee that fast? I don't really drink it so XD Might need an 'A moment later' here. Eh, or could just leave it as is for rule of funny
-> I'm [i]only[/i] here to drink coffee and watch you work. (+)
    {$borsalino}: ...Karma is catching up…
// I like both this response and borsalino's response, but I'm not sure if it'd be a positive reaction? After all, it's putting work on him. Maybe if it was a bit clearer it was a joke?
-> Sure!
    {$borsalino}: Oh, lovely…
    {$borsalino}: Milk, two spoons of sugar, please…
    -> Yes, Sir!
        {$borsalino}: I knew I could count on you…
        You fetch a coffee for Borsalino, and one for yourself. When you come back, {$borsalino} has made some space on the desk for you, among the stacks of paperwork.
    -> Go get it yourself! (+)
        {$borsalino}: Aw… you know I had to try…
        {$borsalino} disappears in a flash of light and reappears with a coffee.
        You make some space for yourself among the stacks of paperwork.
// Same as above, would it be positive? I suppose I'm asking what you're going for here, does he like sass/someone who can banter with him?
Borsalino lays back on his chair, arms comfortably crossed behind his head…
-> Let's get to work! (-)
    {$borsalino}: My, my…

You look at the mess. It's going to be a challenge to get things in order. At least, the stacks and stacks of documents are somewhat divided by theme.
HQ operations… Grand Line strategy… Celestial Dragons.
{$borsalino}: And how do [wave]yooou[/wave] suggest we start?
-> I'll take over one third of the work.
    {$borsalino}: Oh… in that case, would you prefer… let's see…
    -> Internal operations of HQ
        <<jump date_borsalino_2_route1>>

    <<jump date_borsalino_2_route2_pirates>>
// I see what you're going for here, he doesn't like the indecisiveness/drawing things out. I feel from a practical standpoint, though, punishing the user for changing their mind is iffy.

You two work together in silence, taking alternating swigs of coffee. Thanks to your smaller workload (and admittedly better work ethic), you beat your superior to the punch.
{$name}: Finished!
{$borsalino}: Oh, that's marvelous… you're almost as fast as me…
{$borsalino}: Would you like to take over half of the Grand Line work for me?
-> Sure, if it means we will be done sooner…
