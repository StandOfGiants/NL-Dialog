<<set_background "park" show>>
On your way home, you decide to walk through the park. It isn't long before you spot a familiar face.
{$name}: Wait... isn't that Admiral Kizaru?
<<show_character borsalino center fade>>
{$borsalino}: {$name}... [wave]helloo...[/wave]
{$borsalino}: Fancy meeting you here, isn't it...? Are you going that way...?
{$borsalino}: Oh, me too... [wave][i]whaat[/i][/wave] a coincidence...
{$borsalino}: I hope your first day at New Marineford wasn't too stressful...
-> Oh, so is that what you higher-ups call being busy? (+)
    {$borsalino}: Oh... you caught me...
    {$borsalino}: It's hard to focus on paperwork with so many [i]distractions[/i]...
-> It was what I expected from the Navy.
    {$borsalino}: Hmm...
    {$borsalino}: That's... not a very good thing, is it?
-> No, Sir. (-)
    {$borsalino}: Oh... how formal.
    {$borsalino}: You can call me Borsalino...
    <<set $borsalino = "Borsalino">>
-> At least you're there to keep it interesting...  (+)
    {$borsalino}: [wave]Ooh...[/wave]
    {$borsalino}: That is very kind of you...
    {$borsalino}: A new face is always... a very exciting thing, don't you agree...?
-> Say nothing. (-)
    {$borsalino}: ...
{$borsalino}: Well, keep up the, ah, [i]good work[/i]...
{$borsalino}: Do you mind if I smoke?
-> That's bad for your health. (-)
    {$borsalino}: Oh... [wave][i]reaally?[/i][/wave]
    {$borsalino}: That's news to me...
-> It doesn't bother me.
    You watch him light up the cigarette.
    Silence hangs between you.
-> Sure... if you'll share one with me? (+)
    {$borsalino}: Oh my. But of course...
    {$borsalino}: It seems like we'll be walking some of the way together, won't we...?
There's an awkward lull in the conversation while you two walk.
-> Talk about the workday.
    <<jump date_borsalino_1_route1>>
-> Let's grab something to eat!
    <<jump date_borsalino_1_route2>>

You talk about work until the conversation gets deeper.
-> What is it like working with Kuzan? (-)
    {$borsalino}: ... Kuzan, mmm?
    {$borsalino}: Well, we have known each other... for [wave][i]suuch[/i][/wave] a long time...
    {$borsalino}: I can't remember one time I've worked with him...
    <<jump date_borsalino_1_route1_talking_admirals>>
-> What is it like to have your powers?
    <<jump date_borsalino_1_route1_talking_powers>>

    {$borsalino}: ... Sakazuki, mmm?
    {$borsalino}: Ah, everyone thinks he is [wave][i]sooo[/i][/wave] scary...
    {$borsalino}: But he is a very funny guy, actually...
    {$borsalino}: Crunchy outside... soft inside... like bread.

    {$borsalino}: ... Issho, mmm?
    {$borsalino}: It depends. Ah... he's very principled...
    {$borsalino}: Always smiling... hard to tell what he's thinking...
    {$borsalino}: <pause> ...I find that very comforting.

{$borsalino}: ...
{$borsalino}: ...
You almost think he hadn't heard the question, but then...
{$borsalino}: Imagine a roller-coaster...
{$borsalino}: Do you know the moment when it picks up [wave][i]sloowly[/i][/wave] before the fall?
{$borsalino}: And your belly turns...
{$borsalino}: [i]That...[/i] is what it feels like, all the time.
-> I heard about your fight with Rayleigh... (-)
    {$borsalino}: <pause> Ah, yes. Rayleigh.
    {$borsalino}: I had not expected to find him at Sabaody on that day...
    {$borsalino}: Ah... back when he and Roger sailed the seas, you see... Sakazuki and I were rookies...
    {$borsalino}: I was convinced I would catch him someday, you know...?
    {$borsalino}: Well, well... even so many years later, it seems that I lost again...
    {$borsalino}: There's always a next time...
<<jump date_borsalino_1_route4_late>>

-> I heard about your fight with Arlong... (+)
    {$borsalino}: With... whom?
    {$borsalino}: ...
    {$borsalino}: Oh! That fishman?
    {$borsalino}: [wave][i]Yeees, yeees,[/i][/wave] that one... my men certainly feared the Tiger Pirates...
    {$borsalino}: But sometimes, all it takes is one shot... to put them back where they belong...
    <<jump date_borsalino_1_route4_late>>
-> Can you demonstrate?
    {$borsalino}: Mmm... I'm afraid I can't teleport you home.
    {$borsalino}: I get asked that often...
    {$name}: What I actually mean is... maybe somebody could use our help.
    On your way, you see a small boy crying because his kite is stuck on a tree. It's so far away!
    -> Point it out.
        <<jump date_borsalino_1_route1_kite>>
    -> Say nothing.

{$borsalino}: Oh... I hadn't seen that...
{$borsalino}: Are you saying I should shoot that kite?
-> Yes. (-)
    {$borsalino}: That is... not exemplary...
    {$borsalino}: You need to play nice with civilians, {$name}...
    Borsalino disappears, and then reappears in a flash, handing the child his kite. His sobbing quickly dies down, and the boy starts grinning brightly.
    <<jump date_borsalino_1_route4_late>>
-> Of course not, help him! (+)
    {$borsalino}: [wave][i]Aah,[/i][/wave] that's what I thought...
    Borsalino is gone in a burst of light, and reappears handing the kid his kite. His sobbing quickly dies down, and the boy starts grinning brightly.
    {$borsalino}: ... Well, what a strange thing...
    {$borsalino}: I would have probably overlooked it...

{$name}: Let's grab something to eat from that bistro over there.
{$borsalino}: [wave][i]Ooooh[/i][/wave], such a good idea...
<<set_background "restaurant" fade>>
{$borsalino}: Take your pick...
-> I'd like to have dinner already. Noodles? (+)
    {$borsalino}: Oh. Dinner to go?
    {$borsalino}: Gladly...
    {$borsalino}: ...Let me invite you. I suppose this is a date already...

    {$borsalino}: And I don't want to... not really...
    -> Okay, you win.
        Despite the awkward start, you do walk and chat for a bit.
        <<jump date_borsalino_1_route4_late>>
    -> I'm staying.

    <<jump date_borsalino_1_route5_nochoice>>

{$borsalino}: Oh... I never stop to have food outside anymore.
{$borsalino}: It's nice to take the time, isn't it...?
{$borsalino}: These terrasses in summer remind me of the South Blue.
{$borsalino}: Isn't that where you're from?
-> Yes, and I miss home.
-> Yes, but I love traveling. (+)
You tell him about where the place you come from, and you both converse about locations you have traveled to.

    {$borsalino}: Help... don't get angry...
    {$borsalino}: I'm sure you're [wave][i]scaaary[/i][/wave] when you're angry...
    Even though he likes to pick on you, the two of you had a good time together.
    <<jump date_borsalino_1_route2_best>>
-> I didn't want to spend that much time there. (-)
    {$borsalino}: Ah... what did you say?
    {$borsalino}: I'm sorry, I was thinking of something else...
    You two have food without saying much.
    <<jump date_borsalino_1_route4_bored>>
-> If it is... would we get in trouble? (+)
    {$borsalino}: ...
    {$borsalino}: Well, well, {$name}... That depends on your definition of trouble...
    {$borsalino}: And if we did, would it matter...?
    {$borsalino}: What a thing to say...
