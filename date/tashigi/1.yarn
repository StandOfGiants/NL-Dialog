It's late in the afternoon, and even if dinner is already being served at the Mess Hall, you decide to stop by the Office and file the last of the paperwork.
<<set_background "office" show>>
There's so much paperwork, it's a wonder Marines get anything else done.
You open the door, only to find Captain Tashigi bent over a desk on the far end of the room.
<<show_character tashigi center show>>
She is surrounded by mountains and mountains of paper, a deeply concentrated look on her face. Yet, the moment you step into the room, she looks up and smiles as she nods your way.

Tashigi: Oh, hello there.
Tashigi: How is it going? Are you done for the day?
-> Yes, all done! I was about to go grab a bite after filling these papers.
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
-> I'm good, Captain. How about you?
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
-> Yeah, finally done.
Captain Tashigi opens her mouth, but before she can say a word, there is a low, menacing growl that gives you goose bumps.
You look around trying to ascertain the source of such sound. Then, it hits you: it was Captain Tashigi's stomach. She blushes violently as she tries to hide behind a pile of papers.
-> It's getting late. Why don't you take a little break?
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1P1_1>>
-> Paperwork can wait for a while, go get something to eat.
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1P1_1>>
-> (Say nothing)
    <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1P1_2>>

Captain Tashigi looks around her before shaking her head.
Tashigi: No, no. This paperwork needs to be done tonight.
Tashigi: I have no time to get down to the Mess Hall, I'm already behind as is.
-> Then, why don't I bring you some food? You'll need the extra energy.
    <<set_background "mess-hall" show>>
    You rush to the Mess Hall, thinking about the Captain's beaming smile when she agreed to your proposal.
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1SB>>
-> I'll help you out! This way we'll finish faster.
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1P1_3>>
-> Aw, that sucks!
    Tashigi: Actually, I could use the help, if you're free.
    It has been a long day. New recruits don't exactly have it easy, and you are so tired.
-> Sure thing, I'll stay and help.
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1P2>>
-> I just remembered I have this other thing. Sorry.
    Tashigi: Oh, I understand. Go on, then.
    You bid Captain Tashigi goodbye and leave the Office. After all, the Mess Hall won't be open all night, and you've more than earned a big slice of apple pie today.

There's an awkward silence, you don't really know what to do. She is obviously hungry, but there isn't really much you can do about that.
Tashigi: [comment]Pause[/comment]
Tashigi: You should head to the mess hall. It's dinner time already.
-> I'm not all that hungry. Would you like some help?
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1P1_3>>
-> Hope you finish soon.

Captain Tashigi seems surprised. Perhaps it's not that often that new recruits volunteer to work even more.
Tashigi: Oh! You don't have to do that. You should go to the Mess Hall, or they'll run out of dessert.
-> No problem, we'll finish faster together, and then we'll both get dessert.
    Tashigi: Okay, then. I appreciate the help.
    She waves for you to join her.
    <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1P2>>
-> Can't have my superior officer working harder than me!
    You work in a professional manner the rest of the evening.
    Even if you want to get to know more of Captain Tashigi, there's just not a single opportunity to get personal, or at least none that you can see.
    You finish all the paperwork fairly quick, and each go on your separate ways.
    <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1E>>
-> If you say so. Good luck.
    Captain Tashigi probably doesn't like you, anyway.
    You go down to the Mess Hall for dinner. Perhaps you can try again some other time.

<<set_background "office" show>>
When you get back, Captain Tashigi has already cleared up enough space on the desk.
As you eat dinner, the Captain clearly regains some of her energy. She talks with you more openly, and even makes a joke or two. The jokes aren't very good, but you can appreciate the spirit behind them.
Tashigi: This just what I needed, thank you. You're my hero!
Tashigi: Be careful not to get sauce on the papers, or we'll have to start over.
-> Not to worry, I brought napkins too.
    Tashigi: Good thinking!
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
-> Oh. It may be a little too late for that.
    Captain Tashigi takes the piece of paper from your hands, and her fingers brush yours for an instant.
    Tashigi: It's just a copy of a memo, so all good.
    Captain Tashigi is great company. As you eat dinner, you get a little closer together, and you could swear she is leaning forward in her seat, even if just slightly.
    She seems more interested in you than before.
    PC:  Oh, before I forget. I also brought you this.
-> Hot coffee.
    Tashigi: Hmm. This smells delicious.
    She takes a sip of the steaming cup, and her cheeks flush a pretty pink.
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
-> Hot tea.
    Tashigi takes the cup, a shy smile on her mouth as she thanks you.
Once dinner ends, you put away the plates and get back to work.

You sit right in front of Captain Tashigi, and grab a big bunch of papers from the pile closest to you. You work in silence for a while, but you can feel her gaze on you from time to time.
Tashigi: I'm curious, why did you become a Marine?
Tashigi: [comment]Pause[/comment]
Tashigi: Everyone here has varying backgrounds and dreams, yet we all chose to join the Marines. Opinions clash all the time, and if you climb through the ranks you'll probably be asked to make some tough decisions.
Tashigi: So, what is [i]your[/i] motivation for being here?
-> I want the opportunity to help protect the innocent. Perhaps I won't always see eye to eye with fellow Marines, but I'll do my best to act as my heart tells me to.
    Tashigi: That is a fine answer, recruit! I have the feeling we'll get along better than I thought.
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
-> Training as a Marine will grant me power and influence. That way, I could make sure that the world turns into a better place for everyone.
    Tashigi: Seeking power is all good, especially since it's for the reasons you mention.
    Tashigi: However, be sure not to get corruptedâ€”falling into temptation is easier than you think.
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
-> Respect and esteem go hand in hand with being a Marine, plus it pays better than most jobs and I get to travel.
    Tashigi lifts her eyebrows, but doesn't say anything. She simply nods politely.
    Tashigi: I see. You'll find many of our Marines with similar lines of thought.
    She doesn't seem too pleased by that fact.
    You go back to working in silence after that.
    <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1E>>
Tashigi: I myself am from the East Blue, you know, and I've seen first thing how catastrophic pirate activity can be. Ever since I got promoted to the G-5 I haven't been able to go home and visit, but I've always kept my hometown in my thoughts.
Tashigi: I have a brother that still lives there, and I miss dearly, but there's so much work to do here. We send each other letters from time to time, but it's not the same. It is worth it, though, if I can help keep him safe.

-> [comment]Offer details about your family.[/comment]
    PC: I understand the feeling, I have a brother, too, and a sister. They both live with my parents, even though my brother is getting a little old for that.
    PC: I suspect he stays because of my mom's cooking, she is a terrific baker!
    PC: We haven't been corresponding much, though, there's barely enough hours in the day to get the work done as it is.
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    Tashigi: Time does fly by.
    It is getting late. You're having a very nice time with Captain Tashigi, but perhaps it is time to call it a night.
    -> [comment]Offer another fact[/comment]
        PC: Tell me about it, last time I stayed up so late was when my sister had a nightmare and refused to go to sleep until I read her favorite story.
        <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
        <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
        Tashigi: Children can be difficult, but they are also the most resilient. Remind me to tell you some other time about this group of children that stole both pirates and marines hearts.
        A few hours go by, and when Captain Tashigi finally puts down her pen, she lets's out a relieved sigh.
        Tashigi: Thank you for all the help. It's been a while since I had such a delightful time while doing paperwork.
        PC: Me too!
        -> [comment]Smile[/comment]
            <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
        -> [comment]Wink[/comment]
        <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1E>>
    -> [comment]Keep working[/comment]
        Not long after, you finish with all the paperwork. Once Captain Tashigi puts down her pen, she reclines back on her seat, visibly exhausted.
        Tashigi: I think that might be some sort of record.
        Tashigi: Thank you for staying. Now go to bed, it's going to be a long day tomorrow too.
        <<jump date_tashigi_1_TSD1E>>

-> [comment]Offer details about your hometown.[/comment]
    PC: I grew up on the South Blue, and it was always one of my dreams to travel around the world. My little village always felt a little too small for me.
    PC: Don't get me wrong, I love my home, but I've gotten to know so many great people and places since I became a Marine.
    PC: My brother and sister were so jealous when I told them I would be going to all four seas soon.
    PC: They made me promise to bring them souvenirs next time I visit.
    Tashigi: Then you better go into town one of these days. There are many places where you can find perfect gifts.
    <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    You keep working for a while longer, the ticking of the clock getting louder the more times passes and the base grows silent. Almost everyone must be asleep by now.
    Tashigi: Almost done. I can finish up in here if you are too tired. You've already helped me out a great deal.
    -> [comment]Stay until the end[/comment]
        PC: I like to finish what I start.
        When you finally finish, you feel so tired you practically drag yourself to your room. You climb onto bed, knowing that in a couple of hours another day will start anew.
        <<set $ta1_points += 1>>
    -> [comment]Go to bed[/comment]
        PC: I think I'll go catch some sleep. Hope you finish soon!
        You go, and the moment you put my head on your pillow, all lights go out.
