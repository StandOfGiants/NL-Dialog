Coming up to Tsuru's office, the door seems to be closed.
{$name}: [i]This is the right place...[/i]
-> Knock
    Tsuru: Come in!
-> Just go right in
    Tsuru: Oh, there you are! We were just looking for you!
Garp: Eh? Who is this? #pose:chin #expression:questioning
{$name}: Pleased to meet you, Inspector General Sengoku, Instructor Garp, Vice-Admiral Tsuru—
Garp: Ah, you can just drop the titles when we're alone in here. Nobody really cares. Anyway, who are you? #pose:hips
Sengoku: This is Tsuru's new assistant. We were just talking about this! #pose:pocket
Garp: We were? #expression:smile
Tsuru: Ugh. Please ignore them. We're happy to have you here.
-> Is this... normal?
    Rosinante: Pretty much, though everyone is a bit rowdier because of the event later today.
-> I'm just happy to be here!
    Rosinante: We're happy to have you. You're just in time too, since we have an event later today!

{$name}: Event? What kind of event?
{$name}: I think I heard something about that…
Sengoku: It's a welcoming ceremony for the new recruits we have coming in. Something to show them what the Navy's made of, and what to expect! #expression:smile
Garp: Ah... I remember my first day as a rookie... the food was amazing.
Tsuru: That's because you accidentally went to the officer's hall instead of the recruitment ceremony.
Rosinante: That sounds better than my first ceremony... I accidentally set the cannons off.
Tsuru: Oh, I remember that! Let's hope that doesn't happen this time around.
Tsuru: But back to business.
Tsuru: {$name}, we are all writing a speech that myself, Garp, and Sengoku will be presenting at the ceremony. Something about [i]Marine Legends[/i] inspiring the youth... as if I'm old enough to be a legend!
Tsuru: We could use your help with the final touches. There are a lot of... conflicting ideas here.
-> I'd be happy to help!
    Tsuru: Fantastic!
    Sengoku: Finally - someone who wants to help. #expression:joy
    Garp: I don't see why we can't just skip the speech…
    Tsuru: Our recruits need to understand our ideals - not just our strength, Garp!
-> I'd rather just listen; I don't think I have enough speech writing experience for that.
    Garp: See! Someone else who thinks writing this speech is ridiculous!
    Tsuru: We already have a demonstration, Garp - not everything can be accomplished by throwing punches!
-> You said you, Garp, and Sengoku will be performing the speech - what about Rosinante?
    Sengoku: Inspiration! Rosi here is a shining example of what a Marine can be. #expression:smile
    Rosi: I completed a mission a short while ago, something extremely dangerous. The higher ups decided I should get promoted for that... and get some recognition.
    Sengoku: As you deserve. We need to put the finishing touches on your promotion speech as well...
    Tsuru: Let's focus on this speech first, gentlemen.
Tsuru: Now, our first decision is about how we should address the recent rise in piracy...
-> How about ‘Piracy is nothing in the face of a united Navy?'
    <<like rosinante>>
    <<like tsuru>>
    Rosinante: It does enforce the value of working together...
    Tsuru: And draws attention to how the Navy is one force, while the pirates are divided... Perfect! I'll add it in.
    Garp: Being united didn't help us at Marineford...
-> You should write ‘Only with new recruits and new ideas can we overcome this adversary.'
    <<like rosinante>>
    <<like tsuru>>
    Sengoku: Captain Coby and his team of recruits are doing far better work than any old legend...
    Garp: It's good that new blood is changing the way we fight.
    Tsuru: New recruits are nothing without us veterans training them... but I'll add it in.
-> Pirates sail free across the sea?
    <<like garp>>
    <<hate tsuru>>
    Garp: Ha! Perfect - Tsuru, add that in!
    Tsuru: Absolutely not! That's the opposite message we want to send! Let's try something more about defeating pirates, shall we?
-> Just say it: piracy is rising faster than the Navy can fight it.
    <<like sengoku>>
    Tsuru: A bit critical...
    Sengoku: But it is the truth.
    Rosinante: All recruits should know the truth of what they will be fighting. Add it in.
Tsuru: Hmm... Glad that issue is settled. Now, how should we address the disruptions by Straw Hat Luffy and his allies? Impel Down, Marineford, and the like?
-> Straw Hat Luffy's destruction allows us to rebuild bigger and better.
    Sengoku: I don't think we should be endorsing a pirate demolition crew.
    Garp: I do!
    Rosinante: How about a line saying that the Navy always rebuilds?
    Tsuru: Well, we hope they always rebuild. I don't see another Ennies Lobby... but that's a good line, Rosinante.
-> Straw Hat Luffy may be destructive, but he can be defeated like any other pirate.
    Rosinante: To be fair... Straw Hat hasn't been defeated yet.
    Tsuru: He will, though... and the recruits need to believe that he can be.
-> Attacks by this pirate and others are why the Navy serves to protect.
    Rosinante: How many times has that boy done the Navy's job for us, though?
    Garp: Too many. Far too many times.
    Sengoku: The world doesn't know that, though. Let's keep it.
-> Can you even explain anything that bastard does?
    Garp: Bwahaha! You can't!
    Sengoku: Stop being so proud of him!
    Garp: Never! Add it in!
    Tsuru: No, Garp. We'll add something about Captain Coby chasing him; that should work.
Tsuru: Lastly, our recent changes in leadership... and general ideals. This is our most important factor.
-> Absolute justice ensures that no pirate will go unpunished, at any cost. We'll make our world safe at last.
    Sengoku: We've seen how that turns out.
    Tsuru: It is truthful to the Navy's current philosophies...
    Rosinante: Perhaps change the wording to make it more subtle.
    Tsuru: That could work.
-> A Marine's justice is their own, no matter what the Fleet Admiral says.
    Rosinante: Every Marine has their own line that they won't cross.
    Garp: You mean most Marines.
    Tsuru: I'm not sure I like the... vigilantism that this line encourages. Let's have something about a Marine's duty instead.
-> The Navy's change in leadership is reflective of our changing times!
    Rosinante: Marineford did bring many changes to our structure...
    Sengoku: Some of them good, some of them bad.
    Tsuru: Not everything changed; some of us didn't retire, Sengoku. But... I'll keep the line.
-> We'd also prefer it if someone else was in charge.
    Garp: Ha! That's the truth!
    Sengoku: I'm not doing it anymore.
    Tsuru: No one is getting out of retirement until I retire. But... let's say something about justice instead.
Tsuru: That should be the last bit!
Rando Marine: Ma'am! And Sirs! The ceremony will be starting soon.
Tsuru: Finished just in time. Thank you for your help, {$name}! Meet me here after the event, alright?
EVENT - FADE TO BLACK - FADE BACK IN
Tsuru: A resounding success, {$name}! I look forward to working more with you later. Now, for the rest of our work day, what would you like to do?
Tsuru: I have some papers that need to be sent to Sengoku... or you can stay and help me here. Garp should be dropping by in a moment.
-> I'd be happy to help you here, ma'am!
    <<jump workday_legendary_1_GarpTsuruRoute>>
-> I think I want to stretch my legs. I'll take the papers to him!

You decide to stay in Tsuru's office.
Tsuru:  Thank you for staying, {$name}.
Tsuru:  Let's try to get ahead of this workload before-
Garp: Bwah hah hah hah!
Tsuru:  ...
Garp: Hey, Tsuru, back to paperwork already?
Garp: No rest for the wicked, huh?
-> That's easy to say when you're retired!
    <<like tsuru>>
    Tsuru:  Good point, {$name}! I don't even know what "retired" means in the Navy anymore.
-> Hey, are you here to help or to get on our nerves?
    <<like garp>>
    Garp: Ha! You have a spine, kid!
    Tsuru:  What do you expect, Garp?
    Tsuru:  You reap what you sow!
-> Not much else to do around here!
    <<hate garp>>
    <<hate tsuru>>
    Tsuru:  In fact, you just chose to come help.
    Tsuru:  Don't try and get on Garp's better side by pretending otherwise!
    Garp: If you're so bored, I could run you through some drills instead!
-> At least share some of those rice cakes.
    <<like garp>>
    <<hate tsuru>>
    Garp: You've got good taste, but you oughta get your own!
    Tsuru: It's no time for banter.
Tsuru:  You were always a hothead.
Tsuru:  It doesn't matter what we say; he'll stick around. Just try to be quiet.
-> Have you known each other for a long time?
    <<jump workday_legendary_1_GarpTsuruconvo1>>
-> Would you tell me some stories about chasing Gold Roger?

Tsuru:  Indeed, {$name}. We have been comrades throughout our whole career.

Tsuru: That's one way to put it.
-> You sure do have some patience, Vice-Admiral Tsuru!
    <<like tsuru>>

    Tsuru:  And they aren't wrong.
-> I'm sure you made a great team together!
    <<like garp>>
    <<hate tsuru>>
    Garp: We used to chase pirates to the last corners of the blues!
    Garp: And don't forget about Sengoku... We had many adventures.
    Tsuru:  Perhaps we should reminisce some other time!
-> Was it different back then? Beijng a Marine?
    Tsuru: The times have changed. Our Navy has to adapt, but the core stays the same.
    Garp: I'd say the times haven't changed enough.
    Garp scoffs. It seems like this is a conversation they have had often.
    You notice the tension between the two of them.
    -> I hope that we can maintain peace together!

Garp: Ah, Roger! It's incredible that, decades after his death, he's not quite gone!
Tsuru:  As much as I disagree with giving a pirate the status of a legend, it's true...
-> Did you chase him as well, Tsuru?
    Tsuru:  I did, back in the day.
    Tsuru:  Sengoku, too. So did everyone we mentored. But I think, by the end, only Garp could keep up with him.
    Garp: Heh, those were the days... too bad that in the end, he got hung out to dry.
    -> At least he died and that was the end of it.
        <<hate garp>>
        <<hate tsuru>>
        Garp: Hm.
        Tsuru:  Roger might've died, but the trouble he caused is still very much alive.
    -> I think Tsuru should hang [i]you[/i] out to dry!
        <<like tsuru>>
        <<like garp>>
        Garp erupts in laughter. Tsuru chuckles.
        Tsuru:  It won't work to discipline him.
        Tsuru:  Believe it or not, Garp's heart is in the right place.
-> How did you get him in the end?
    Garp: We didn't.
    Garp: Three times we had him cornered, and three times he got away!
    Tsuru:  Not everybody knows this, {$name}.
    Tsuru:  It's one of the difficult decisions that had to be made from the top.
    -> I understand why.
        <<like tsuru>>
        <<hate garp>>
        Garp: What?! Really?!

        <<hate tsuru>>
        Tsuru:  …Well.
        Tsuru:  Let's focus on the task at hand.
-> I thought stories about Roger would be a little more... exciting.
    <<hate tsuru>>
    <<hate garp>>
    Garp: What a thing to say to two old-timers like us!
    Tsuru:  Old-timers?! Speak for yourself

Tsuru sighs.
Tsuru:  Still, I'm glad that we are working together after all this time... at least, in [i]some[/i] capacity.
Garp: Yeah! You're not getting rid of me that easily!
Garp: You want to catch up with the workload so we can all enjoy Rosinante's promotion in peace too, huh?
Tsuru:  ...Yes.
Tsuru:  I think that's something we can all agree on.
Garp: I'm glad the boy is back, too! Bwahahah!
Garp seems to be content with sticking around, even helping a little, as you two work.

You walk quietly until you reach Sengoku's office. You knock on the door.
Sengoku: Come in!
{$name}: Good afternoon, Inspector General. Commander.
Unexpectedly, Rosinante is also in the office. You couldn't hear what they were talking about before you entered, but you can see a wanted poster on the table between them. Peaking closer, you notice it is the poster of Trafalgar Law.
Sengoku: {$name}, Tsuru sent you?
{$name}: Yes.
-> Give Sengoku the papers.
    <<like sengoku>>
    Sengoku: Hmm? What are these for?
    {$name}: I'm not sure. Tsuru-san just gave them to me.
    {$name}: I assumed you would know.
    Sengoku: Yes...
    Sengoku: Rosinante, it's about your promotion.
    Rosinante: We didn't get to talk about that even though we meant to, right?
    -> Congratulations on your promotion!
        <<like rosinante>>
        <<like sengoku>>
        Rosinante: Ah, thank you, thank you. It's nothing, really.
    -> It would be ideal if you figured out the details as soon as possible, then.
        <<like sengoku>>
        Sengoku: {$name} is right. We can't just sit around. We need to plan the ceremony.
        Sengoku: We got caught talking about [i]other issues.[/i]
        Rosinante: How is this an issue?
        Sengoku: Of course it's an issue! We were just talking about it.
    -> How could [i]you[/i] possibly get promoted?
        <<hate rosinante>>
        <<hate sengoku>>
        Sengoku: {$name}... Rosinante may be younger than me and Tsuru-san but he's still a superior, so be respectful.
        Sengoku: Tsuru-san would disapprove of such an attitude and you know it.
        {$name}: You're right, Inspector. I apologize.

You glance at the wanted poster on the table again.
{$name}: Is the Worst Generation causing trouble again?
Sengoku: Pfft, trouble is too light of a word.
{$name}: Why? What's happening?
Sengoku: I'm sure you heard that Straw Hat Luffy and Trafalgar Law formed an alliance. After Doflamingo's fall, they plan to take down Kaidou!
Rosinante: And how is that an issue?
-> Rosinante-san is right. Isn't there a chance that they could defeat Kaidou?
    <<like rosinante>>
    Sengoku: Don't be foolish. They don't stand a chance.
    Rosinante: Pfft, don't be so sure of that.
    Sengoku: Rosinante, whose side are you on?!
    <<jump workday_legendary_1_CS1B>>
-> I don't see the issue. Let them take each other out. Less paperwork for us, right?
    <<like sengoku>>
    <<hate rosinante>>
    Rosinante: That's easy for you to say.
    Sengoku: {$name} isn't wrong, you know.
    Sengoku: Are you a Marine, Rosinante? Or did working undercover among pirates for so long make you think like them?
    Rosinante: I'm just saying that not all of them are bad.
    Sengoku: Bad or not, they still cause too much trouble to simply let them run wild.
    <<jump workday_legendary_1_CS1B>>
-> Is there anything we can do to stop them?
    Sengoku: Heh! I like your enthusiasm, but that's not under our jurisdiction.
    Sengoku: Let Sakazuki figure it out; I'm done with all that!
    Rosinante: Yeah... we're just talking for the sake of conversation. I doubt the Fleet Admiral will deploy any of us at this base to deal with this.
    -> You're right. I don't even know what I would do if I found myself face to face with any of those pirates. They're way too strong.
        <<like rosinante>>
        <<hate sengoku>>
        Sengoku: Don't give them so much credit!
        Rosinante: It's fine, Sengoku-san! Haha.
        Rosinante: {$name} isn't wrong. Out of us three, you're the only one who could stand a chance.
        Sengoku: Don't try to flatter your way out of this! Don't think I didn't notice how you've been sympathizing with the pirates for so long.
        Sengoku: It's unacceptable for someone of your rank!
        Rosinante: Yes, yes, I've heard it before.
        Sengoku: And yet you never listen.
        Sengoku: What will I do with you...
        <<jump workday_legendary_1_CS1B>>
    -> It's still a nice thought.
        <<like sengoku>>
        <<hate rosinante>>
        Rosinante: Let other people deal with it.
        Sengoku: You want to do good things, and I appreciate it, but you're still just a recruit.
        Sengoku: You'll have to get a lot stronger.
        {$name}: I don't mind! I will get stronger.
        Sengoku: Hahaha! See, Rosinante? This is the sort of attitude I want from you as well.
        Sengoku: Maybe one day, after you stop fraternizing with the enemy…
        Rosinante: ...

The way Rosinante is talking about the pirates is odd, but you also can't help but notice how close he and Sengoku seem to be. Almost like a father and son.

    {$name}: I bet it's great to work so closely with your father figure like this, right?
    Rosinante: It can be a bit of a headache sometimes.
    Sengoku: ...
