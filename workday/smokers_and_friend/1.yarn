<<set_background "mess-hall" show>>
It's orientation day in your new assignment with Vice Admiral Smoker and his group. You gulp, entering the mess hall- no need to be nervous, right? You should just do your best to get to know them. You can trust your training group to prepare you for your role in the Marines.

On that note, you sit down next to the group of four, all of them eating in relative silence despite the loud cacophony of voices echoing in the busy space.
Bellemere: Hey look! The newbie finally showed! Don't worry kid, I hate getting up at the crack of dawn, too.
Tashigi: You are a bit late, but the compound can be difficult to navigate at first.
Hina: Hina will be assessing your obedience and potential.
Smoker: Hope you're ready for some hard work. Damn, I'm all out of coffee…

You notice Bellemere make an odd face, something like disapproval, though the others do not seem to react at all beyond the Vice Admiral handing his cup to you dismissively. You get the coffee like the good little gopher you signed up to be when you joined the Marines, eager to please.
Smoker: Thanks. Just the right amount of sugar, too– you're not bad, kid.
<<increment "wd1.smoker">>
-> It was no problem.

<<decrement "wd1.tashigi">>
Bellemere: Well, they have a realistic attitude, at least. Geez, Tashi-chan, you don't have to get on the kid's case on day one.
Tashigi: There is a difference between realistic and insubordinate. We won't be doing {$pronoun_them} any favors by being so lax.

Smoker: So, we're going to be splitting up into a couple of different groups. {$name}, you can come with me and Hina to do some drills by the docks…
Hina: (explains Tashigi's option (swordplay) and Bellemere's (training grounds/obstacle course). Maybe hint that they could be good for the new recruit, too?) // unwritten
Bellemere: Uh, right. Training grounds. That's totally where I plan to spend my time today.
She winks your way, unseen by the others, and you're not sure what to make of that.
{$name}: All of these things seem like they'd be really useful training for an actual battle. Do you all always separate like that?
Tashigi: They are all essential in the training of a Marine. You will be expected to take part in every activity during your rotations, but for now you are free to choose where to start.

Smoker: Ever hear about too many cooks spoiling the pot? Too many of us giving orders and we'll butt heads, and it's nothing like how it would be in the field with one commanding officier to every however many subordinates.
-> Don't you usually work with Captain Tashigi?
    Smoker: Yeah, but we're mixing things up a little.
-> But what if I want to learn from all of you?
    Smoker: You'll get other chances.
-> Yeah, getting that many orders seems like a drag.
    <<increment "wd1.bellemere">>

Smoker: 'Sides, we've all got different things we teach best.
-> Great. Could you go over the options again?
    Tashigi: It is quite a bit of information. Ask as much as you need, but be sure to pay attention.
    <<increment "wd1.tashigi">>
-> Who's the best teacher overall?
    <<increment "wd1.hina">>
    Smoker: That's for you to make up your mind about. I'll go over the choices again.
-> So you don't switch up who teaches what?
    Smoker: Every so often, but it's been a while. So, let's see...

Smoker: We've got the first plan, naval drills with me and Hina. Tashigi and her sword stuff. Captain Bellemere and her obstacles. What'll it be?
-> I like the original plan- I'd love to try naval drills!
    <<jump workday_smokers_and_friend_1_Part_2A>>

Smoker and Hina lead the way to the docks, keeping a quick pace with each other. The three of you arrive at a large warship. Several unfamiliar people who look to be trainees look as if they're expecting Smoker and Hina. Once you board the deck, they motion for everyone to gather around.
    // description a little confusing
Smoker: You'll be fighting a mock battle together. Hina and I are in command, so listen up.
Hina: A decoy ship armed with your fellow Marines posing as its attending crew will be attempting to storm the deck, just as you might encounter in a real naval battle. Your objective will be to work as a team to hold them off and detain their captain.
Smoker: I'm sure some of you have done this before, and I think this is in a manual.
Hina: The plan we're adapting is in the Standard Warship Drills section of your combat manual.
-> Oh, I know this one!
    <<increment "wd1.hina">>
    <<decrement "wd1.smoker">>
    Hina: Hina appreciates those of you who came prepared.
-> I knew I should have read that.
-> Sounds familiar, but I learn better by doing.
    <<increment "wd1.smoker">>

Smoker: The winner here is the first team to knock the other team's captain into the water. For the purposes of the drill, I'm your commanding officer. Any questions?
    // requires clarification: win state contradicts what Hina said earlier.
-> Nope, I got it.
-> What happens if we knock people who aren't the captain into the water?
    Smoker: Good question. Nothing, except they get wet– you don't get points for that.
    Hina: In a real naval battle there will not be time to ask questions, {$name}. Right, everyone in positions!
-> Wait, are we actually using real weapons or what?
    Hina: What an asinine question. As if you would be opening fire on your fellow Marines.
    <<decrement "wd1.hina">>
    Smoker: Your weapons have been replaced with water guns, standard procedure.

You are positioned at a cannon in the rear of the ship along with several others, while other Marine-trainees stand ready on the deck.
A sailor yells out the alert. You can see the other 'crew' (and a few familiar faces from your cohort of newbies!) on the decoy ship. Pirates, indeed.
Smoker: Okay, they're approaching. What are you thinking here?
Hina: Smoker, you are modeling for the new recruits. Must Hina always be reminding you to demonstrate leadership? In an actual naval battle, you would not be standing around asking what your crew is thinking. Really.
Smoker: Nah, I do it all the time. They're not moving fast. It's better to know where your subordinates' brains are.
Hina: Hina is unimpressed. What would Tashigi-chan think if she saw you conducting drills with such a lackadaisical attitude?
Smoker: I know her well enough. So, {$name}, what are you thinking?
-> At the ready and waiting for orders.
    <<increment "wd1.hina">>
-> I'll see how they attack when they get closer in range and make adjustments.
-> I need to be prepared for anything!
    <<increment "wd1.smoker">>
    Hina: They will be following the drill.
    Smoker: You don't know that.

The decoy ship draws closer. No one in your crew seems ready to make the first move, but then again, perhaps you should wait for the pirates to act first? You can see the opposing captain from your position - but is the ship close enough yet to open fire? Should you make the first move? Or wait?
Hina: That's it, maintain position, don't attack until they're within range, otherwise we waste energy, ammo and resources.
Smoker: Don't just sit back and wait for them to come to you. In a real battle, you're not going to know what they're going to do. The sooner you make your move, the more likely it is you'll take them by surprise.

The other ship's captain topples from his perch at the ship's helm as a water balloon hits him in the face, leaving his crew stunned, which affords your crew the opportunity to open fire. The drill is over!

Smoker: Well, I can't fault you for going that way when you know their battle plan…
You fire your cannon in a BOOM of the largest water balloon you've ever seen, as the cannon's alongside you do the same. The rival ship is rocked by the onslaught of water and the ship's ‘captain' goes tumbling into the water. The drill is over!

There are three trees down the path, deep emerald and dotted with small unripened fruit, and you settle in a bench beneath their shade.
PC: How long until the mikans ripen?
Bellemere: Hmm… I'd say a couple more months, at least. On a day as hot as this, it's important to take care of yourself. I like to sit here and think sometimes…

Bellemere: Oh yeah? Let's see what you got, then, newbie.
You wonder, as she stands up from the bench, if she means for you to follow her to the shooting range or something and get some training in after all. However, she stops only a little further away, and bends to gather small pebbles off the gravel path.
Bellemere: Can you throw me a couple cans from behind the bench?
She points.
You look, and sure enough there's a [i]rather impressive[/i] pile of empty soda and beer cans discarded under the bench. They tell a story of frequent truancy. You grab them one at a time and toss them to the Commodore, who catches them easily and begins to line them up on the ground, a good hundred yards away.
Bellemere: Okay, here's your ammo.
She hands you a fistfull of pebbles and you stare at them a moment before looking back up, perplexed.
{$name}: You want me to… hit the cans with these little rocks?
Bellemere: Yeah. Knock 'em all down and maybe I'll share some of my mikans with you when they ripen.
You size up the little cans, not too sure of your chances. She didn't say you had to do it in one go, though, so… with enough persistence, you could probably do it.

You aim carefully at the cans, selecting the heaviest little stones you have. You manage to knock down all the cans before running out of pebbles, though it's definitely a challenge.

Tashigi: Ah, crap!
Captain Tashigi squints as she frantically looks around her feet.
Tashigi: I… I dropped my glasses.
It's clearly a futile search. You had noticed her glasses earlier, but it's only now that you realize just how much she needs them. She drops to her knees, and you can hear her whispering.

    {$name}: The Vice Admiral would probably just be glad he doesn't have to deal with the paperwork of my demise in the line of duty. You totally had me there!
    Captain Tashigi lets out a laugh.
    Tashigi: You would have blocked in time, I'm sure.
    {$name}: Nah, I was definitely done for. Saw my life flash in front of my eyes. It's my lucky day, I guess.
    Tashigi: Ha! If you say so… the Vice Admiral does hate paperwork, you know, so I'll try to reel it in.
    Tashigi: Oh, here they are!
    Captain Tashigi picks up her glasses and blows on the lenses, trying to get most of the dirt off them. She accepts your hand when you offer it, and you help her stand up.
    Tashigi: Thanks. Now, where were we?

You spar for a while. Despite your background training, your breathing becomes erratic.
-> This is just the workout I needed!
    Tashigi: You're not half as bad as I thought. There is certainly some potential!

-> My hand is about to fall off, can we take a break soon?
    Tashigi: One more round, and we'll move on to perfect your technique. Great job so far!
    <<increment "wd1.tashigi">>
-> This is too hard! I give up.
    Tashigi: Hmm. At this rate, you won't last a month. Survive this next round, and we'll talk about a break.

Captain Tashigi does not go easy on you. Your every muscle aches, and you soon find yourself struggling not to let go of your sword. You hold on to it, even if by sheer will power.
After a while, even the talented swordswoman in front of you needs to pause to catch her breath.
Tashigi: That's good enough for now.
She takes off her fogged glasses, frowning, and reaches for a small piece of cloth from one of her pockets. She starts to clean the lenses carefully, albeit absentmindedly, as she continues talking.
Tashigi: I'm sure you must have some questions for me, I can tell. Let's hear them.
-> [comment]Ask why she chose the garden for the training[/comment]
    {$name}: Why are we training here and not in the training grounds?
    Tashigi: Captain Bellemere is running her obstacle course, it's best we don't get in the way.
    Tashigi: Besides, it's a lovely day outside, don't you think?
    A soft breeze rolls through the garden, along with the sweet smell of freshly cut grass. Warm sunlight bathes her face and bounces off her pitch-black hair, making it almost glow blue.
    It certainly is a lovely day, you think.
    Tashigi: Ok, break's over.
    Tashigi: Let me see that stance again.
-> [comment]Ask about her interest in swords[/comment]
    {$name}: What made you choosechose to be a swordswoman?
    Captain Tashigi seems taken aback by your question, but after a moment's hesitation she clears her throat.
    Tashigi: Come to think of it, I have always liked swords, ever since I was a child.
    {$name}: Why?
    Tashigi: In the past, I've met so many swordsmen unworthy of the blades they carry, ignorant of their past and their true potential.
    Tashigi: And the first thing you need to know is that each sword is… unique in their making, with a history of their own. Perhaps a will of their own, too. They aren't just [i]tools[/i] for us to use.
    Captain Tashigi chuckles as she shakes her head.
    Tashigi: I'm rambling, now. Let's get back to work.
You prepare yourself for the next round, but Captain Tashigi's sword stops mid-swing. She frowns as she looks at something behind you.
You turn around, and you spot a red haired figure in the Commodore's coat reclining underneath the shade of a couple of trees.
Captain Tashigi motions for you to follow her, and together you make your way towards the seated figure.
As you approach, you recognize Commodore Bellemere, who is quick to stand up the moment you are within earshot. // awkward phrasing. perhaps 'once she sees your approach'?

Upon meeting, the two women look grim, eyeing each other up and down.
Bellemere: Uh, hey, Captain Tashigi.
Tashigi looks tired and a little sweaty- she's obviously been putting effort into her sword practice. Bellemere, on the other hand, looks fresh as a daisy.
Bellemere: Working hard?
Tashigi: Commodore Bellemere. Hardly working, are we? How was the… obstacle course?
Bellemere: I mean, honestly? I wasn't really feeling it today. Look around! It's so nice and balmy… sometimes you just have to slow down and enjoy life. Take care of the things that are important, you know?
Captain Tashigi sighs.
Tashigi: Why am I not surprised? Your not [i]feeling it[/i] translates into unprepared marines. And see, Petty Officer {$name}, we in the Marines usually consider the safety of our officers as [i]important[/i].
Bellemere: Oh, I know all about keeping my priorities in order and protecting others. I was fighting pirates years before you were old enough to lift that sword, you know… plus, I didn't feel like running today.
She says the last stubbornly, like a petulant child trying to argue and running out of words.
Tashigi: The obstacle course would be done by now, you're just making excuses at this point, Bellemere. You know what, whatever, it's not worth getting into it with you right now.
Captain Tashigi turns to look at you.
Tashigi: Come now, {$name}, let us not waste any more time.
Bellemere: Waste time?! Implying you're going to do more? You're going to pass out from this heat! Am I right, {$name}?
-> Well, actually… I think Captain Tashigi has a point.
    <<lock_out_date bellemere>>

        <<unlock_date tashigi>>
    Bellemere looks very displeased - maybe even disgusted - with you right now. You doubt you'll be spending a lot of free time with her in the future.
    Tashigi: Seriously, to have the new recruit be more responsible than a Commodore….
    Captain Tashigi pats you on the back, an approving smile on her lips.
-> Yeah! You have to take care of your health, first.
    <<lock_out_date tashigi>>
    if is_greater_than("wd1.bellemere", 4)
        <<unlock_date bellemere>>
    Tashigi looks exasperated, but Bellemere grins.
    Bellemere: See that? I got the newbie on my side here, Tashi-chan.
    Maybe you've give the Captain a bad impression. You doubt, based on the bespectacled woman's expression, that you'll be spending much time with Captain Tashigi one-on-one in the near future.
At the end of the day you go to bed thinking over everything that happened between your two superiors. Hopefully, you've made the right decisions…
