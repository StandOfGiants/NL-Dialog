You arrive at the mostly vacant bar. Following behind you are four intimidating figures, their heights and statures dwarfing everyone else around them.
{$sakazuki}: I told you it's too early to get a drink. #expression:frown
{$kuzan}: …It's never too early when we have to deal with you.
{$sakazuki}: What did you just say?
{$issho}: Gentlemen, let's give this bonding exercise a try first. We don't have to do it for long, but it's worth the gamble.
{$borsalino}: [wave]Soo…[/wave] anyone want to order a drink?
{$sakazuki}: I don't drink on the job.
{$borsalino}: One for me, please.
{$kuzan}: Hit me, two.
{$issho}: I'll pass this time. Perhaps another day. #expression:smile
{$borsalino}: What about [wave]you[/wave], {$name}?
-> If I go to a bar, I'm obliged to get a drink! (K & B +1, S -1)
    {$kuzan}: That's the spirit, {$name}!
-> No, thank you, Admiral. I'd rather stay sober for work later. (S & I +1, K -1)
    {$borsalino}: Suit yourself.
The bartender takes everyone's order and a few moments later, drinks are passed around. Right! You are supposed to be the one promoting teamwork through bonding exercises. Now is your chance to shine.
You place your drink down to get everyone's attention.
{$name}: It's not really a proper bonding exercise if we just sit around saying nothing! Let's make sure the time we spend together is utilized to its fullest!
{$issho}: Oh? Do you have a suggestion for what we should be doing, {$name}?
->  Well, it's a bonding exercise — it wouldn't be much of a bonding exercise if we don't talk at all, right?
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Talk_route>>
->  How about a game of darts? Sometimes friendly competition is all you need to have a good time.
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Dart_choice>>
->  You guys wait right here for a minute! I have just the thing!

<I don't know how to write the code so that once an option is picked, it can't be picked again. Someone with coding knowledge, send help>
{$kuzan}: So… what do you want to talk about? Don't be shy.
-> How did you guys meet?
    [i]It might have been the right thing to ask.[/i]
    {$issho}: I have known Saka-san for a while. We go far back. He was stationed at a base and… #expression:smile
    // [fade to black]
    {$borsalino}: … *[wave]Soo[/wave]* when he found out I could teleport into the pantry, we became the best of friends…
    {$sakazuki}: Ignore them, they are fools. Do you have any further questions?
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Talk_route>>
-> Tell me the most embarrassing experience you've been through!
    The Admirals look at one another. Admiral Kizaru gives an easy grin.
    // Borsalino smiles
    {$borsalino}: *[wave]Weell…[/wave]* this is a long story. When I was a cadet, there was this dare board in the campus, and there'd be a list of dares. At the end of the week we'd pick our winner. So one time… [fade to black]
    // Sakazuki embarrassadade
    {$sakazuki}: ... And that's why there's a hole in the storage room in the old Marineford. They figured it'd be easier to try and convert the room to a storage room rather than just mess with the infrastructure. So… yes…
    // Kuzan smiles
    {$kuzan}: [shake]Hahaha![/shake] Ararara! It was you?! I never knew! So the rule stickler Sakazuki's got a dark side, too, huh?
    {$sakazuki}: Shut up! It wasn't like that! I was new at controlling my power, okay?!
    {$issho}: Let's not fight in a bar, Saka-san, Kuzan. {$name} seems to still have questions for us. What do you want to ask us about?
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Talk_route>>
-> So… what is the deal with Vice Admiral Aramaki?
    The question makes the Admirals' demeanor change quite suddenly. {$issho} looks vaguely amused, while the others look annoyed. Finally, Kuzan speaks up.
    {$kuzan}: That Sakazuki groupie? Eurgh. Competed with Issho for the Admiral position but lost. I suppose there's one thing we can all agree on… screw him.
    {$borsalino}: Oh, we [wave]dooo[/wave]…
    {$sakazuki}: Hmph! He had better not screw up my very clear orders this time.
    {$kuzan}: Ararara, I didn't mean it like that now that you mentioned it…
    {$borsalino}: Isn't he your friend, Issho?
    // Issho smiles
    {$issho}: Even the best of friends can have disagreements. <pause> He's a… spirited individual.
    Kuzan:... Anyway… Let's talk about something else.
    Well, that is that.
 <<jump workday_admirals_1_Talk_route>>
->  Tell me a good thing about each other!

There's an awkward silence. No one seems willing to speak up. This situation requires some initiative. You smile and point toward the group.
How about you start first….
->  Fleet Admiral Sakazuki?
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Path_1>>
->  Admiral Aokiji?
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Path_2>>
->  Admiral Kizaru?
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Path_3>>

{$sakazuki}: Me? Tch. <pause> They are qualified Marine soldiers. Hmph.
{$borsalino}: Ah, Sakazuki, that's so nice coming from you…
{$kuzan}: Really good at the boosting moral part of Fleet Admiral, huh?
Fleet Admiral Sakazuki eyes the other two in annoyance.
{$sakazuki}: Don't make a habit out of it.
{$issho}: Now, now, Saka-san. That's not nice. They are being genuine.
<<jump workday_admirals_1_Date_unlock2>>

{$kuzan}: Something nice? Uhh... Issho has a real good poker face, you never know with him.
{$issho}: Thank you, Kuzan. I'm flattered you think so.
{$borsalino}: Kuzan's temperature is a good thing in the summer, too.
{$kuzan}: And Borsalino is really good at… ah, what is it… that turns on and off? Forget it.
{$issho} laughs good naturedly while Fleet Admiral Sakazuki just scowls.
// Sakazuki frowns
{$sakazuki}: Annoying.

{$borsalino}: Oh, there are only *[wave]good[/wave]* things to say about my friends. Sakazuki and his passion... Kuzan and his temperament... Issho... is very brave, too, isn't he...? He doesn't mind what anybody thinks... just *[wave]look[/wave]* at him.
// issho smiles
{$issho}: Thank you. You're a very remarkable man yourself, Borsalino.
{$kuzan}:  Passion is one way to put it with Sakazuki…
// Sakazuki frowns
{$sakazuki}: What do you mean ‘one way to put it'?

{$issho}: I think they are all very unique people. Kuzan is very kind. Borsalino is very playful. And Saka is... a man who stays true to his words.
{$kuzan}: Ararara… you aren't too shabby yourself.
{$borsalino}: It's [wave]truuue[/wave].
{$sakazuki}: Hn. If only you hadn't caused us to lose face.

Not wanting a fight to start, you decide to step in. Turning to the person you admire the most, you give them a smile.
->  I think Admiral Aokiji is pretty &&cool!&&
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Kuzan_unlock>>
->  You brighten up any room you're in, &&Admiral Kizaru!&&
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Bors_unlock>>
->  {$issho}, you have such amazing luck!
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Issho_unlock>>

{$borsalino}: Oh… Ice-cold…
{$kuzan}: Not cool, getting hot under my collar, haha.
{$issho}: That's a classic one, but still good.
{$sakazuki}: Hn.
{$kuzan}: Are you jealous, Sakazuki?
{$sakazuki}: Of your frequent failure to secure a date? Not a chance.
{$issho}: Gentlemen, please, let's not turn this into a fight.
After that, the conversation flows smoother than before. You exchange banter with them with relative ease. It's actually fun once they loosen up. You glance at the clock, noticing the time.

<<set_sprite "smile">>
{$issho}:   Don't mind him. He's just jealous. It looks like you have an admirer, Borsalino.

{$borsalino}: Oh, Sakazuki, you're becoming quite popular…
{$kuzan}: Another Sakazuki groupie? Eurgh…
{$issho}: Vice Admiral Aramaki would be having a fit. Competition for the Fleet Admiral's attention? Oh dear.

{$name}: Let's play darts!
All the Admirals shrug and nod. It seems they all agree on something for once.
{$kuzan}: No lightspeed crap, Borsalino.
{$borsalino}: I would [wave]*never…*[/wave]
The group moves toward the corner of the bar with the darts. You do them the courtesy of grabbing the darts they will all use.

{$issho}: So, who goes first?
{$kuzan}: You mean who sets the bar to beat?
{$sakazuki}: Hn, worried Kuzan?
{$kuzan}: Not as much as you should be.
{$borsalino}: I'll go first…

Admiral Kizaru takes a dart from your hand and lines up his shot. With a flick of his wrist, the dart shoots straight home. Bullseye! Wow! You expected nothing less from an Admiral!

{$borsalino}: Ooh, looks like I've set the bar pretty high…
{$sakazuki}: Pft. -He takes a dart from you next, lining up his shot. He lets the dart loose from his hand. It flies straight and true, embedded right next to Admiral Kizaru's! Two bullseyes?! The competition is heating up!-
{$kuzan}: That's off center. -He snags a dart from you, gloved hand brushing against your fingers, and lets the dart fly! It slams home, right next to the other two. Three bullseyes in a row? Was that even possible?!-
{$issho}: It appears my colleagues have set the bar quite high… I will have to give it my all.
{$sakazuki}: Hn, don't try and guilt us.
{$kuzan}: Oi, no gravity stuff from you Issho!

You hand the last dart to {$issho}. He tilts his head a little, leaning on his walking stick. After a moment, he lets the dart fly. Another bullseye?! Wow, all the Admirals are no joke!

{$issho}: Oh, did this blind old man get a bullseye?
{$sakazuki}: Psh.
{$kuzan}: Man, a four way win is pretty boring.
{$borsalino}: This is interesting, isn't it {$name}...?
{$issho}: {$name} what do you think?

-> I think Admiral Aokiji was the most uh, center?
    {$kuzan}: Told you you were off center, Sakazuki.
-> I think Admiral Kizaru had the advantage of going first so… he got the closest sorry.
    {$borsalino}: [wave]Beggars can't be choosers[/wave]
-> {$issho} got the closest!
    {$issho}: Thank you, {$name}.
-> Um, I think the Fleet Admiral is the most center? And maybe the deepest?
    {$sakazuki}: Good eye, {$name}. What did you say about off center, Kuzan?

{$kuzan}: Well, that happened. I need another drink.
{$issho}: I'm sure that can be arranged, we are in a bar.
{$sakazuki}: Distasteful hobby.
{$borsalino}: I would like to play another [wave]round[/wave]? With more interesting stakes perhaps?
Everyone: Stakes?

->  Hm, let's do something else instead. Darts is too easy for you all.
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Outro>>
->  Another round would be fun, let's up the ante!
    <<jump workday_admirals_1_Round_2>>

{$kuzan}: Alright, what's the catch?
{$issho}: Perhaps the winner doesn't have to pay for drinks.
{$borsalino}: [wave]Ooooh! That's a fun idea, Issho![/wave]
{$sakazuki}: Hmph, fine.
{$name}: It was a little too easy last time, maybe I could be a little more active this round…
-> Get more drinks for everyone!
    {$kuzan}: Great, another round! I'm going to win this one for sure now.
-> Bump into the others nonchalantly. Keep them on their toes!
    {$borsalino}: Oh, careful {$name}! Wouldn't want to cause chaos now, would *[wave]yoou[/wave]…?*
-> Cheer them on!
    {$issho}: Thank you for your confidence, {$name}.
-> Double check the darts and the board to make sure there is no funny business. A level playing field is the only way to go.
    {$sakazuki}: -Nods at you in thanks-
This time there is a clear winner, no ties here, and it's… *drumroll*...
RANDOM WINNER DECIDED
{$borsalino}: Oh… it's me. What a surprise~…
{$issho}: Ah! Don't worry, I shall only take a little advantage of the free drinks.
{$kuzan}: Nothing better than free alcohol!
{$sakazuki}: Hn, the rest of you need to brush up on your skills. Preparedness is key.

You notice that Kuzan and Borsalino are acting shifty and decide to approach them.
{$kuzan}: Hey, um. Hey.
{$borsalino}: Can we help *[wave]yooou[/wave]?*
{$kuzan}: …
{$borsalino}: ...
{$kuzan}: <pause> (Psst.. I think they know.)
{$borsalino}: Hmmm, *[wave]okaaay[/wave]…*
{$borsalino}: Let's let {$name} in on it…
{$borsalino}: But first… be good and promise *[wave]noot[/wave]* to tell anybody about it, will you?
-> OK… What could go wrong? (B+)
    {$borsalino}: What indeed…
-> No way. Tell me what's going on first! (K+)
    {$kuzan}: Dahaha… {$name} is not dumb.
{$kuzan}: Let's just say we have a special something for magma asshole over there.
You squint at the object Borsalino is pulling from the inside of his pocket.
A flask…
Of hot sauce?
-> What do you plan to do with that?
    {$borsalino}: Oh… it's a treat…
    {$borsalino}: Just spicing up the work day…
    {$kuzan}: Man…
-> Isn't Sakazuki immune to that? (-1)
    {$borsalino}: [wave]Weell[/wave], aren't you pessimistic…?
    {$kuzan}: Only one way to know for sure.
-> That's completely unprofessional! (-2)
    {$borsalino}: Oh… [wave]*whaat*[/wave] is, exactly?
    {$kuzan}: So you're one of *those people*, huh.
    Kuzan turns away from you. Borsalino waves you away with a hand.
-> I thought you guys were friends?
    {$borsalino}: Oh, we are.
    {$borsalino}: Isn't it normal… to tease your friends? Enjoy making them [wave]*reaally*[/wave] angry?
    {$kuzan}: Uh… no.
    {$kuzan}: I think he's an idiot.
You just found out that Borsalino and Kuzan are planning to prank Sakazuki.

{$borsalino}: [wave]Ooh…[/wave] what a nice surprise…
{$kuzan}: Cool.
{$kuzan}: The plan is to spike his drink.
{$borsalino}: [wave]*Saay,*[/wave] while we're on that topic…
{$borsalino}: There's enough for two drink What do we think about the purple guy…?
{$kuzan}: Nah. I like Issho.
{$borsalino}: Mmm… Let's let {$name} choose, shall we...?
-> Let's prank Issho as well. (B+2, K-1)
    {$kuzan}: Man… isn't it cruel to prank a blind guy?
    {$kuzan}: I'm out.
    {$borsalino}: Ahh, fine… you're too good for us, Kuzan…
    Borsalino winks at you.
-> No, I agree with Kuzan. (K+2, B-1)
    {$borsalino}: Ah… it's two against one, I suppose…
{$kuzan}: Let's stick to Sakazuki.
{$kuzan}: {$name}, how about you go distract him?
{$kuzan}: Borsalino is the fastest of us, so he'll…
{$kuzan}: …
{$kuzan}: It's done, isn't it.
{$borsalino}: *[wave]Yees[/wave],* but you can keep talking…
The next time the Fleet Admiral takes a swig of water, he gets unnaturally red in the face and really tense…
{$sakazuki}: …!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
{$issho}: Oh, it's suddenly rather hot, isn't it?
Sakazuki lets out some choked noises, getting on his feet and leaving before you can see his reaction.
(Workday ends. After this, the Sakazuki date is perma locked?)

You decide to approach Sakazuki.
Kuzan and Borsalino are side-eyeing you.
{$sakazuki}: What is it?
{$sakazuki}: …I see.
{$sakazuki}: Very mature.
Sakazuki eyes Kuzan with deep contempt. A look that could kill.
{$kuzan}: Uh. {$name} is telling him.
{$kuzan}: Borsalino.
{$kuzan}: ... Borsalino??
{$issho}: Oh, did he stand you up, Kuzan?
{$sakazuki}: Hot sauce, huh?
{$sakazuki}: I suppose this degree of maturity is to be expected from someone who considers *drinking* their pastime.
{$sakazuki}: I'll see you at work.
Before he heads for the exit, Sakazuki turns to you.
S: ...I appreciate that.

You decide to approach Issho, in hopes he can help you avoid the prank without telling Sakazuki.
Kuzan and Borsalino are still whispering.
{$issho}: Oh. {$name}. Are you enjoying your-
{$issho}: …
{$issho}: It's very kind of you to tell me.
{$issho}: Well, now I'm curious… what do you suggest we do?
-> Let's prank them back! (I+)
    {$issho}: I was thinking the same.
    {$issho}: Though, for the sake of peace, there might be something else we can do…
-> Let's make up an excuse and leave.
    {$issho}: Hmm…
-> Could you tell Sakazuki for me? (S+)
    {$issho}: Heh… are you too shy to do that yourself?
    {$issho}: I will make sure he knows that he has at least one ally.
{$issho}: Knowing Borsalino, he has already tampered with the drink as we speak…
{$issho}: No time to lose, have we? Sakazuki!
{$sakazuki}: Hm?
{$issho}: Be so kind as to tell a blind man the time.
While Sakazuki turns around, you watch as Issho leans in with his walking cane and knocks Sakazuki's drink over.
{$borsalino}: *[wave]Ooh[/wave]…*
{$kuzan}: (Did he do that… on purpose?)
{$sakazuki}: …
{$sakazuki}: You can be very clumsy.
{$issho}: We'll say fate didn't want you to drink that water, Sakazuki.

{$borsalino}: The office calls but I don't want to answer…
{$sakazuki}: We need to get back to work, we have been goofing off too long as it is.
{$issho}: There is always more work to be done.
They seem pretty split. What do you want to do?

-> We should get back to work, this was just supposed to be a lunch break anyway. (K-1, B-1, S+1, I+1)
-> I don't think working with a non-clear head is a good idea. I think we should take the day to rest. (K+1, B+1, S-1, I-1)
